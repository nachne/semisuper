BACKGROUND/AIMS We investigated whether the anticancer drug Ukrain ( UK ) is able to modulate the expression of some of the key markers of tumor progression in pancreatic cell carcinoma , in order to assess its potential therapeutic effect .	[]
METHODS Three cell lines ( HPAF-II , PL45 , HPAC ) were treated with UK ( 5 , 10 and 20 Î¼M ) for 48 h , or left untreated .	[]
Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine ( SPARC ) mRNA levels were assessed by real-time PCR .	[]
Matrix metalloproteinases ( MMP)-2 and -9 activity was analyzed by SDS zymography ; SPARC protein levels in cell lysates and supernatants were determined by Western blot .	[]
Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometric analysis , and invasion by matrigel invasion assay .	[]
RESULTS UK down-regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 , suggesting that UK may decrease pancreatic cancer cell invasion , as confirmed by the matrigel invasion assay .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
SPARC protein down-regulation in supernatants points to an inhibition by UK of extracellular matrix remodeling in the tumor microenvironment .	[]
At the same time , SPARC mRNA and cellular protein level up-regulation suggests that UK can affect cell proliferation by cell cycle inhibition , showing a cell cycle G2/M arrest in UK-treated cells .	['evading growth suppressors']
CONCLUSION Our results suggest that UK modulates two major aspects involved in tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer cells , such as extracellular matrix remodeling and cell proliferation .	[]
