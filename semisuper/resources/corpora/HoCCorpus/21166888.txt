Currently there is no good hepatocyte model for studying growth hormone ( GH ) function that reflects its normal physiological roles .	[]
Here we report the establishment of a functional hepatocyte cell line , SDRL-1 , from the liver of young male spontaneous dwarf rats ( SDR ) , with isolated GH deficiency .	[]
This line has been maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM)/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) with retention of a near diploid karyotype for extended periods of time .	[]
When grown as a monolayer sheet , it displayed a pavement-like appearance and contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
These cells have a poorly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum ( r-ER ) , few mitochondria and glycogen granules , and produce a small amount of albumin and Î±-fetoprotein , that is enhanced when grown on a collagen gel sponge .	[]
Human recombinant GH stimulated JAK2 and STAT5b tyrosine phosphorylation and IGF-I production in a concentration-dependent manner .	[]
When the cells were cultured with GH-supplemented medium , the number of mitochondria and glycogen granules increased together with the r-ER and Golgi apparatus .	[]
A number of microvilli were observed on the surface of the cultured cells , further suggesting that this cell line is composed of normally functioning hepatocytes .	[]
In summary , we established a novel hepatocyte cell line ( SDRL-1 ) , that appears to display normal function , which we propose can serve as a good in vitro model for studying GH-target organ interactions .	[]
