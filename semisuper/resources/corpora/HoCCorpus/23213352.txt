Group VIB Phospholipase A(2) ( iPLA(2)Î³ ) is distributed in membranous organelles in which Î²-oxidation occurs , that is , mitochondria and peroxisomes , and is expressed by insulin-secreting pancreatic islet Î²-cells and INS-1 insulinoma cells , which can be injured by inflammatory cytokines , for example , IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ , and by oxidants , for example , streptozotocin ( STZ ) or t-butyl-hydroperoxide ( TBHP ) , via processes pertinent to mechanisms of Î²-cell loss in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus .	[]
We find that incubating INS-1 cells with IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ , with STZ , or with TBHP causes increased expression of iPLA(2)Î³ mRNA and protein .	[]
We prepared INS-1 knockdown ( KD ) cell lines with reduced iPLA(2)Î³ expression , and they proliferate more slowly than control INS-1 cells and undergo increased membrane peroxidation in response to cytokines or oxidants .	[]
Accumulation of oxidized phospholipid molecular species in STZ-treated INS-1 cells was demonstrated by LC/MS/MS scanning , and the levels in iPLA(2)Î³-KD cells exceeded those in control cells. iPLA(2)Î³-KD INS-1 cells also exhibited higher levels of apoptosis than control cells when incubated with STZ or with IL-1Î² and IFN-Î³ .	[]
These findings suggest that iPLA(2)Î³ promotes Î²-cell proliferation and that its expression is increased during inflammation or oxidative stress as a mechanism to mitigate membrane injury that may enhance Î²-cell survival .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
