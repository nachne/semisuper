Paragangliomas are relatively uncommon neoplasms that arise in adrenal and extra-adrenal paraganglia of the autonomic nervous system .	[]
Parasympathetic paraganglioma develop predominantly in the head and neck .	[]
It is exceedingly uncommon to develop a primary intraparathyroid paraganglioma .	[]
There is only a single case report in the English literature .	[]
The information from the single previous case report ( Medline 1960-2009 ) was combined with this case report .	[]
Our patient was a 69 year old woman who presented with a thyroid gland mass , with extension into the substernal space .	[]
The patient had a history of renal cell carcinoma removed 18 months before .	[]
At surgery , a thyroid lobectomy and a parathyroidectomy were performed .	[]
The parathyroid tissue showed a very well defined zellballen arrangement of paraganglion cells within the parenchyma of the parathyroid gland .	[]
The cells had ample basophilic , granular cytoplasm .	[]
The nuclei were generally round to oval with ' salt-and-pepper ' nuclear chromatin distribution .	[]
There was a richly vascularized stroma .	[]
Mitotic figures , necrosis , invasive growth , and profound nuclear pleomorphism were absent .	['resisting cell death', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
The neoplastic cells were strongly and diffusely immunoreactive with chromogranin , synaptophysin , CD56 , and focally with cyclin-D1 .	[]
The paraganglioma showed a delicate S-100 protein positive supporting sustentacular framework .	[]
Keratin , CD10 , PTH , calcitonin and RCC markers were negative .	[]
The patient showed no stigmata of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia ( MEN ) and has no paraganglioma in any other anatomic site .	[]
She is alive without any additional findings 12 months after surgery .	[]
Isolated paraganglioma within the parathyroid is rare , and should be separated from parathyroid adenoma , hyperplasia or metastatic disease to assure appropriate management .	[]
