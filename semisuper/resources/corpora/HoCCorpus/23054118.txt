BACKGROUND : The immune system has been shown to play an important role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) .	[]
The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) in blood is an easily assessable parameter of systemic inflammatory response .	[]
The aim of this study was to determine whether the NLR is prognostic in GIST .	[]
METHODS : A total of 339 previously untreated patients with primary , localized GIST operated at our institution between 1995 and 2010 were identified from a prospectively collected sarcoma database .	[]
NLR was assessed preoperatively .	[]
Patients who received adjuvant imatinib treatment were excluded from the analysis ( n=64 ) .	[]
Cox regression models were calculated and correlation analyses were performed .	[]
RESULTS : On univariate analysis , NLR was associated with recurrence-free survival ( RFS ) ( P=0.003 , hazard ratio 3.3 , 95% confidence interval 1.5-7.4 ) .	[]
Patients with a low NLR had a 1- and 5-year RFS of 98 and 91% , compared with 89 and 76% in those with a high NLR .	[]
The median RFS was not reached .	[]
Positive correlations were found between NLR and mitotic rate ( Pearson correlation coefficient [ r]=0.15 , P=0.03 ) , and NLR and tumor size ( r=0.36 , P=0.0001 ) .	[]
RFS in patients with a GIST&gt;5cm with low NLR was significantly longer compared to patients with high NLR ( P=0.002 ) .	[]
Flow cytometry analysis of freshly obtained GISTs revealed that neutrophils constituted a minimal percentage of intratumoral immune cells .	['avoiding immune destruction']
CONCLUSIONS : NLR is a surrogate for high-risk tumor features .	[]
Elevated blood NLR appears to represent systemic inflammation in patients with high-risk GIST .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
