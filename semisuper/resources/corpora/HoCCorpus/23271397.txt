OBJECTIVES : Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for pancreatic cancer ( PaCa ) .	[]
However , the mechanisms of smoking-induced PaCa remain unknown .	[]
Here we investigated the effect of smoking compounds on cell death pathways in pancreatic ductal cells , precursors of PaCa .	[]
METHODS : Human pancreatic ductal cells ( HPDE6-c7 ) were cultured with cigarette smoke extract ( CSE ) or smoking compound 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone ( NNK ) .	[]
Apoptosis and autophagy were assessed by DNA fragmentation and immunofluorescence , respectively .	[]
RESULTS : Exposure to CSE or NNK decreased DNA fragmentation and up-regulated BclXL .	[]
Akt kinase was activated by smoking compounds through reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Specifically , Akt activation was prevented by inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidase .	[]
Molecular or pharmacologic inhibitions of Akt prevented the antiapoptotic effect of smoking compounds .	['resisting cell death']
Smoking compounds stimulated rapid ( 1 hour ) and transient activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and formation of autophagic vacuoles , indicating stimulation of autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
Repeated exposure to CSE/NNK ( 48 hours or longer ) abolished the early activation of autophagic markers .	['resisting cell death']
Inhibition of Akt prevented the antiautophagic effect of long exposure to smoking compounds , indicating that smoking-induced late activation of Akt prevents autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
CONCLUSIONS : Long exposure of pancreatic ductal cells to smoking compounds inhibited apoptosis and autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
The results revealed a central role for Akt kinase in mediating key procarcinogenic effects of smoking compounds .	[]
