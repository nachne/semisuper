BACKGROUND : The p38Î± MAP kinase pathway is involved in inflammation , cell differentiation , growth , apoptosis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² .	[]
The overproduction of these cytokines plays an important role in cancer .	[]
The aim of this work was to design a peptide inhibitor on the basis of structural information of the active site of p38Î± .	[]
METHODS : A tetrapeptide , VWCS as p38Î± inhibitor was designed on the basis of structural information of the ATP binding site by molecular modeling .	[]
The inhibition study of peptide with p38Î± was performed by ELISA , binding study by Surface Plasmon Resonance and anti-proliferative assays by MTT and flow cytometry .	[]
RESULTS : The percentage inhibition of designed VWCS against pure p38Î± protein and serum of HNSCC patients was 70.30 and 71.5% , respectively .	[]
The biochemical assay demonstrated the K(D) and IC(50) of the selective peptide as 7.22ï¿½10(-9)M and 20.08nM , respectively .	[]
The VWCS as inhibitor significantly reduced viability of oral cancer KB cell line with an IC(50) value of 10Î¼M and induced apoptosis by activating Caspase 3 and 7 .	['resisting cell death']
CONCLUSIONS : VWCS efficiently interacted at the ATP binding pocket of p38Î± with high potency and can be used as a potent inhibitor in case of HNSCC .	[]
GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE : VWCS can act as an anticancer agent as it potentially inhibits the cell growth and induces apoptosis in oral cancer cell-line in a dose as well as time dependent manner .	['resisting cell death']
Hence , p38Î± MAP kinase inhibitor can be a potential therapeutic agent for human oral cancer .	[]
