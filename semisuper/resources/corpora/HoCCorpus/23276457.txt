Bladder cancer ( BCa ) remained a major health problem .	[]
Med19 was related to tumor growth of BCa .	[]
Bone morphogenetic proteins ( BMPs ) were reported to be critical in bone metastasis of cancer .	[]
We therefore investigated the relations between Med19 and BMPs in BCa and their effect on bone metastasis of BCa .	[]
Bladder cancer cell lines were cultured and interfered with Med19 shRNA and control .	[]
Expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-2 , BMP-4 , BMP-5 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , BMP-9 , and BMP-15 were studied between 2 groups .	[]
Fifty-two BCa samples were included for immunohistochemical staining of Med19 and BMP-2 .	[]
Expressions were scored and studied statistically .	[]
Invasiveness was studied with Transwell assay .	[]
Silencing or Med19 in BCa cells induced altered expressions of BMPs .	[]
Increased expressions of BMP-1 , BMP-4 , BMP-6 , BMP-7 , and BMP-15 and decreased expressions of BMP-2 , BMP-5 , and BMP-9 were noticed , but only BMP-2 reached statistical significance .	[]
Expressions of Med19 and BMP-2 were significantly higher in cases with bone metastasis and were positively correlated in cases with bone metastasis and muscle invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Med19 is a critical factor involved in the invasiveness and promotion of bone metastasis of BCa , possibly via BMP-2 .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
