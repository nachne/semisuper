The aim of the present study was to investigate the apoptosis of human ovarian cancer cell lines , A2780 and CP70 , induced by a novel curcumin analogue , B19 .	[]
The proliferation of cells was detected with methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ( MTT ) assay and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry .	[]
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) were assessed by the fluorescent indicator DCF-DA .	[]
The protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress pathways , GRP78 , XBP-1 , ATF-4 and CHOP , was examined with Western blotting .	[]
A growth inhibitory effect was observed after treatment with B19 in a dose-dependent manner and with more potential than curcumin .	[]
At 20 ï¿½M , B19 induced significant apoptosis in CP70 cells .	['resisting cell death']
Furthermore , B19 induced the ER stress response , while curcumin had no effect on ER stress .	[]
These results suggest that B19 has more effective antitumor properties than curcumin , and is associated with the activation of ER stress and ROS in ovarian cancer cells .	[]
