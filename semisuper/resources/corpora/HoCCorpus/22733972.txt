Elevated phosphorylation of estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ± ) at serines 118 ( S118 ) and 167 ( S167 ) is associated with favorable outcome for tamoxifen adjuvant therapy and may serve as surrogate markers for a functional ERÎ± signaling pathway in breast cancer .	[]
It is possible that loss of phosphorylation at S118 and/or S167 could disrupt ERÎ± signaling , resulting in aggressive ERÎ±-independent breast cancer cells .	[]
To this end , MCF-7 breast cancer cells were stably transfected with an ERÎ±-specific short hairpin RNA that reduced endogenous ERÎ± .	[]
The resulting cell line was stably transfected with wild-type ERÎ± ( ER-AB cells ) , or ERÎ± containing serine to alanine mutation at S118 or S167 ( S118A cells and S167A cells , respectively ) .	[]
These stable cell lines expressed approximately equivalent ERÎ± compared with parental MCF-7 cells and were evaluated for growth , morphology , migration/invasion , and ERÎ±-regulated gene expression .	[]
S118A cells and S167A cells exhibited increased growth and migration/invasion in vitro .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Forward- and side-scatter flow cytometry revealed that S167A cells were smaller in size , and both S118A and S167A cells exhibited less cellular complexity .	[]
S118A and S167A cells expressed pancytokeratin and membrane localization of Î²-catenin and did not express vimentin , indicating retention of epithelial lineage markers .	[]
Expression of ERÎ±-target genes and other genes regulated by ERÎ± signaling or involved in breast cancer were markedly altered in both S118A and S167A cells .	[]
In summary , attenuated phosphorylation of ERÎ± at S118 and S167 significantly affected cellular physiology and behavior in MCF-7 breast cancer cells , resulting in increased growth , migration/invasion , compromised expression of ERÎ± target genes , and markedly altered gene expression patterns .
