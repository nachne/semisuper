Objective .	[]
The present study was performed to investigate the effect of N-desulfated heparin on basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) expression , tumor angiogenesis and metastasis of gastric carcinoma .	[]
Methods .	[]
Human gastric cancer SGC-7901 tissues were orthotopically implanted into the stomach of NOD SCID mice .	[]
Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups which received either intravenous injection of 0.9% NaCl solution ( normal saline group ) or 10âmg/kg N-desulfated heparin ( N-desulfated heparin group ) twice weekly for three weeks .	[]
In vitro , human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells were treated with N-desulfated heparin in different concentration ( 0.1âmg/mL , 1âmg/mL , N-desulfated heparin group ) , and treated with medium ( control group ) .	[]
Results .	[]
In vivo , the tumor metastasis rates were 9/10 in normal saline group and 2/10 in N-desulfated heparin group ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The intratumoral microvessel density was higher in normal saline group than in N-desulfated heparin group ( P &lt ; 0.05). bFGF expression in gastric tissue was inhibited by N-desulfated heparin ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	[]
There was no bleeding in N-desulfated heparin group .	[]
In vitro , N-desulfated heparin inhibited significantly bFGF protein and mRNA expression of gastric carcinoma cells ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Conclusions .	[]
N-desulfated heparin can inhibit the metastasis of gastric cancer through inhibiting tumor bFGF expression and tumor angiogenesis with no obvious anticoagulant activity .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
