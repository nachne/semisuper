The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AHR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the effects of the environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) .	[]
Recently , AHR has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer by virtue of its ability to modulate estrogen receptor-Î± ( ERÎ± ) signalling and/or its ability to block cell proliferation .	[]
Our previous studies identified cyclin G2 ( CCNG2 ) , an inhibitor of cell-cycle progression , as an AHR target gene ; however , the mechanism of this regulation is unknown .	[]
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays in T-47D human breast cancer cells revealed a TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR , nuclear co-activator 3 ( NCoA3 ) and the transcription factor forkhead box A1 ( FOXA1 ) , a key regulator of breast cancer cell signaling , to CCNG2 resulting in increases in CCNG2 mRNA and protein levels .	[]
Mutation of the AHR response element ( AHRE ) and forkhead-binding sites abolished TCDD-induced CCNG2-regulated reporter gene activity .	[]
RNA interference-mediated knockdown of FOXA1 prevented the TCDD-dependent recruitment of AHR and NCoA3 to CCNG2 and reduced CCNG2 mRNA levels .	[]
Interestingly , knockdown of FOXA1 also caused a marked decrease in ERÎ± , but not AHR protein levels .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
However , RNA interference-mediated knockdown of ERÎ± , a negative regulator of CCNG2 , had no effect on TCDD-dependent AHR or NCoA3 recruitment to or expression of CCNG2 .	[]
These findings show that FOXA1 , but not ERÎ± , is essential for AHR-dependent regulation of CCNG2 , assigning a role for FOXA1 in AHR action .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
