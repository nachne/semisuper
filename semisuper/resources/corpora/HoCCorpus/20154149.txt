It is crucial for organ homeostasis that epithelia have effective mechanisms to restrict motility and cell proliferation in order to maintain tissue architecture .	[]
On the other hand , epithelial cells need to rapidly and transiently acquire a more mesenchymal phenotype , with high levels of cell motility and proliferation , in order to repair epithelia upon injury .	[]
Cross talk between cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling is crucial for regulating these transitions .	[]
The Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex is an effector complex downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 .	[]
We previously showed that translocation of this complex from cell-matrix to cell-cell adhesion sites was required for the establishment of contact inhibition of proliferation .	[]
In this study , we provide evidence that this translocation depends on cadherin function .	[]
Cadherins do not recruit the complex by direct interaction .	[]
Rather , we found that inhibition of the normal function of cadherin or Pak1 leads to defects in focal adhesion turnover and to increased signaling by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase .	[]
We propose that cadherins are involved in regulation of contact inhibition by controlling the function of the Pak1-betaPIX-GIT complex at focal contacts .	['evading growth suppressors']
