CDKN1C/P57 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor implicated in different human cancers , including hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ; however , little is known regarding the role of CDKN1C/P57 and its regulation in HCC .	[]
In this study , we show that the down-regulation of Notch1 and Notch3 in two HCC cell lines resulted in Hes1 down-regulation , CDKN1C/P57 up-regulation , and reduced cell growth .	[]
In line with these data , we report that CDKN1C/P57 is a target of transcriptional repression by the Notch effector , Hes1 .	[]
We found that the up-regulation of CDKN1C/P57 by cDNA transfection decreased tumor growth , as determined by growth curve , flow cytometry analysis , and cyclin D1 down-regulation , without affecting the apoptosis machinery .	[]
Indeed , the expression of Bax , Noxa , PUMA , BNIP(3) , and cleaved caspase-3 was not affected by CDKN1C/P57 induction .	['resisting cell death']
Morphologically CDKN1C/p57-induced HCC cells became flat and lengthened in shape , accumulated the senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase marker , and increased P16 protein expression .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Evaluation of senescence in cells depleted both for Hes1 and CDKN1C/P57 revealed that the senescent state really depends on the accumulation of CDKN1C/p57 .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Finally , we validated our in vitro results in primary HCCs , showing that Hes1 protein expression inversely correlates with CDKN1C/P57 mRNA levels .	[]
In addition , reduced Hes1 protein expression is accompanied by a shorter time to recurrence after curative resection , suggesting that Hes1 may represent a biomarker for prediction of patients with poor prognosis .	[]
