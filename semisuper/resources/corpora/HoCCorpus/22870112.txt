Overexpression of growth factors and/or their receptors is a common event in malignancy and provides the underlying mechanisms for one of the hallmarks of cancer , uncontrolled proliferation .	[]
Mounting evidence suggests that IGF-1 is involved in the pathogenesis and progression of different types of human cancer such as colon , breast , prostate and lung .	[]
However , only a few studies have investigated the association between IGF-1 levels and childhood cancer risk .	[]
We aimed to compare the IGF-1 serum level in children with de novo malignancies to healthy children , and to assess its relationship with cancer type , stage , metastasis and different disease characteristics .	[]
The study was carried out on 100 children ; 50 children with de novo malignancies and 50 healthy children of matched age and gender as a control group .	[]
The patients were subjected to a routine work-up for their cancers according to our local standards .	[]
Estimation of the serum level of IGF-1 was carried out in the two groups using ELISA .	[]
Our results showed that children with cancer had significantly higher levels of IGF-1 than healthy controls of the same age and gender .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
No association was found between IGF-1 and tumor type , stage , metastasis and other disease characteristics .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In conclusion , the IGF-1 serum level is an important indicator of risk for the most prevalent forms of childhood cancer .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
It may be used to identify children at the highest risk for these cancers and aid in determing who may benefit most from preventive strategies .	[]
Given the small number of children in our study , studies with larger populations are required to confirm these results .	[]
