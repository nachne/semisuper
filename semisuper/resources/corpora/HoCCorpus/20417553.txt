Polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) are ubiquitous contaminants in the marine environment .	[]
Their toxicity is mainly linked to the ability of marine species to biotransform them into reactive metabolites .	[]
PAHs are thus often detected at trace levels in animal tissues .	[]
For biomonitoring purposes , this findings have two main consequences , ( i ) the determination of the PAH tissue concentration is not suitable for the evaluation of individual exposure to PAHs ( ii ) it can explain sometimes the lack of correlations obtained with relevant markers of toxicity such as genotoxicity biomarkers .	[]
The aim of the present study was to better investigate the link between PAH exposure and genotoxicity in marine flatfish .	[]
During a laboratory experiment , juvenile soles were exposed for four weeks to a mixture of three PAHs , namely benzo[a]pyrene , fluoranthene and pyrene , followed by one week of depuration .	[]
Fish were exposed via the trophic route to a daily PAH concentration of 120 Î¼g/g food .	[]
Fish were sampled at different time points .	[]
The bioavailability and the biotransformation of PAHs were assessed by the measurement of biliary metabolites using a sensitive UPLC MS/MS method .	[]
The 7-ethoxyresorufine-O-deethylase was also measured in liver subcellular fractions as a biomarker of phase I biotransformation activities .	[]
Genotoxicity was assessed in parallel by the measurement of DNA strand breaks in fish erythrocytes by the alkaline comet assay .	['genomic instability and mutation']
During this study , the high amount of PAH metabolites produced in sole demonstrated the bioavailability of PAHs and their biotransformation by fish enzymes .	[]
A positive correlation was observed between the level of hydroxylated PAH metabolites and genotoxicity as measured by the alkaline comet assay .	['genomic instability and mutation']
