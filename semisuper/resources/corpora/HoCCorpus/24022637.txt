Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) gene amplification and overexpression are commonly present in glioblastoma , and confer advantages of growth , invasiveness and radio/chemotherapy-resistance for tumour cells .	[]
Here , we assessed the role of EGFR activation for downstream mitogenic signalling in the commonly used glioblastoma cell line U251 .	[]
Despite the high expression level , activation of EGFR under standard culture conditions was low .	[]
Intact EGFR function was verified by the rapid phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream mitogen-activated protein(MAP) kinase ERK1/2 upon addition of exogenous EGF to serum-starved cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
By contrast , addition of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) activated downstream ERK1/2 via the MAP kinase kinase without phosphorylating EGFR .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
A phosphoreceptor tyrosine kinase array showed FBS-induced activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R),and the IGF-1R inhibitor AG1024 inhibited FBS-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 , implying IGF-1R as the major driver of FBS-associated mitogenic signalling in the absence of exogenous EGF .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These findings have important implications for in vitro drug testing in glioblastoma .	[]
Moreover , activation of ERK1/2 was also strongly influenced by growth state and cell density of U251 cultures .	[]
Re-seeding exponentially growing cultures at high cell density induced p27/CDKN1B expression and suppressed P-ERK1/2 indicating a certain regulation of proliferation by contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
Strikingly , highly activated ERK1/2 signalling and cell cycle progression occurred when cells were released from plateau phase regardless of high seeding density .	[]
This phenomenon might implicate a proliferation response in the early recurrence observed after clinical therapy in glioblastoma patients .	[]
However , whether it will recapitulate in vivo remains to be demonstrated .	[]
