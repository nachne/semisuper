Molecular mechanisms involved in progression of clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas ( ccRCCs ) are poorly understood .	[]
A common genetic mutation found in ccRCC is the loss of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) gene , which contributes to cancer progression and metastasis .	[]
We investigated VIP effects on metastatic and angiogenic factors in human VHL-null A498 ccRCC and HK2 renal cells .	[]
VIP increased adhesion but decreased expression of metalloproteinases , MMP2 and MMP9 , as well as cell migration and VEGF expression and secretion in A498 but not in HK2 cells .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
VIP enhanced ROS levels and decreased nuclear levels of Î²-catenin and NFÎºB p50-subunit in A498 cells , suggesting neuropeptide involvement in the observed decrease of metastatic ability in clear-cell carcinoma .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
VIP effects in A498 cells were blocked by the VPAC(1/2)-receptor antagonist JV-1-53 .	[]
In conclusion , present data point to a role of VIP in preventing invasion and metastasis in ccRCCs and support its potential therapeutic usefulness in this disease .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
