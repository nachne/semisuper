The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug tepoxalin on canine tumour cell growth and describe the changes associated with tepoxalin treatment .	[]
In vitro experiments were performed to assess tepoxalin-associated alterations in tumour cell growth .	[]
Clinically achievable tepoxalin concentrations did not significantly alter tumour cell growth in vitro .	[]
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± dose-dependently increased in vitro in the presence of tepoxalin .	['inducing angiogenesis']
A canine osteosarcoma xenograft was used to determine in vivo effects of tepoxalin on tumour growth and angiogenesis .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Despite increased VEGF in vitro , there was a significant growth delay associated with tepoxalin treatment .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Normal dogs were administered tepoxalin to assess effects on systemic VEGF production , but not found to have significantly increased VEGF .	['inducing angiogenesis']
These data suggest that tepoxalin may moderately inhibit tumour growth and may be administered as an analgesic to tumour-bearing dogs .	[]
