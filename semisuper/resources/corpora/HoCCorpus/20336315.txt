PURPOSE Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme in aerobic glycolysis ; inhibition of PKM2 leads to the tumor growth inhibition .	[]
In this study , the effects of combined treatment with cisplatin ( DDP ) and a plasmid that expresses a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) targeting PKM2 on the growth of human A549 xenograft lung cancer model were investigated .	[]
METHODS The expression of PKM2 in A549 cells was determined by immunofluorescence .	[]
PKM2 expression levels were evaluated by Western blot analysis .	[]
In a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model , the effects of treatment with shRNA , with or without cisplatin , on tumor volume were determined .	[]
Apoptosis and cell proliferation status were examined to determine the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition .	[]
RESULTS Expression of shRNA targeting PKM2 resulted in inhibition of PKM2 expression in A549 cells .	[]
In the lung cancer xenograft model , average tumor volume in the group treated with both cisplatin and shRNA was statistically lower than those of other groups ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	[]
The levels of apoptotic cells were significantly higher in samples from animals in the combined treatment group than those from untreated animals ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['resisting cell death']
The cell proliferation rate , as determined by counting cells labeled with an anti-phospho-histone H3 , a marker for mitosis , was lower in samples from animals treated with both cisplatin and shRNA than in samples from other groups ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	[]
CONCLUSIONS Use of RNA interfering ( RNAi ) targeting PKM2 significantly inhibited tumor growth when combined with cisplatin in a human A549 lung cancer xenograft model .	[]
The enhanced antitumor activity of the combined treatment compared to treatment with shRNA alone may result in part from increased induction of apoptosis and augmented inhibition of cancer cell proliferation .	[]
