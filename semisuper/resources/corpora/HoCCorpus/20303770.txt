Certain steroidal compounds have demonstrated an antiproliferative effect against several tumor cell lines ; however , their complete role on cancer cells is not currently established .	[]
Herein , we report the synthesis and evaluation of two new 26-hydroxy-22-oxocholestanic steroids on cervical cancer CaSki cells .	[]
The title compounds were prepared from diosgenin and hecogenin in excellent yields .	[]
We determined their effect on cell proliferation , cell cycle , and cell death .	[]
The cytotoxic effect of the title compounds on CaSki and human lymphocytes was also evaluated , indicating that the main cell death process is not necrosis ; the null effect on lymphocytes implies that they are not cytotoxic .	['resisting cell death']
The observation of apoptotic bodies as well as the increase in the expression of active caspase-3 along with the fragmentation of DNA confirmed that such new cholestanic frameworks induced apoptosis in tumor cells .	['resisting cell death']
Significantly , their antiproliferative activity on tumor cells did not affect the proliferative potential of normal fibroblasts from cervix and peripheral blood lymphocytes .	[]
The title compounds show selective antitumor activity and therefore serve as promising lead candidates for further optimization .	[]
