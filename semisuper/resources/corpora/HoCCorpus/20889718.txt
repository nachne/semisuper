Estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ± ) expression in breast cancer is predictive of response to endocrine therapy ; however , resistance is common in ERÎ±-positive tumors that overexpress the growth factor receptor ERBB2 .	[]
Even in the absence of estrogen , ERÎ± can be activated by growth factors , including the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) .	[]
EGF induces a transcriptional program distinct from estrogen ; however , the mechanism of the stimulus-specific response is unknown .	[]
Here we show that the EGF-induced ERÎ± genomic targets , its cistromes , are distinct from those induced by estrogen in a process dependent on the transcription factor AP-1 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The EGF-induced ERÎ± cistrome specifically regulates genes found overexpressed in ERBB2-positive human breast cancers .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
This provides a potential molecular explanation for the endocrine therapy resistance seen in ERÎ±-positive breast cancers that overexpress ERBB2 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These results suggest a central role for ERÎ± in hormone-refractory breast tumors dependent on growth factor pathway activation and favors the development of therapeutic strategies completely antagonizing ERÎ± , as opposed to blocking its estrogen responsiveness alone .
