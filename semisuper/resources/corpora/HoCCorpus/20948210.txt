BACKGROUND Ginkgolic acids ( GAs ) , extracted from the seed coat of Ginkgo biloba L. Our previous study has shown that GA monomer could inhibit the growth of Hep-2 significantly and induce the fragmentation of the chromosomal DNA .	[]
To further assess the antitumor potential and turn it into a candidate new antitumor drug , the antitumor mechanism of GA was investigated .	[]
METHOD The cytotoxicity and antitumor effect of GA monomer were assayed by MTT colorimetric assay with nontumorogenic MC-3T3-E1 as well as tumorogenic Hep-2 and Tac8113 cell lines .	[]
The effect of GA monomer on the proliferation of tumor cell lines was analyzed with MTT colorimetric and CFSE labeled assay .	[]
Cell cycle distribution and measurement of the percentage of apoptotic cells were performed by flow cytometry following stained with propidium iodide , annexin V-FITC .	[]
The expression of apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 , Bax and caspase-3 was analyzed with Western blot .	[]
RESULT GA only inhibited the growth of tumorogenic cell lines in a both dose- and time-dependent manner .	[]
Tumor cells were treated with GA for 72 h , 70.53 Â± 4.54% Hep-2 and 63.5 Â± 7.2% Tca8113 cells were retarded at GO/G1 phase , and the percentage of apoptosis was 40.4 Â± 1.58 and 38.4 Â± 1.7% , respectively .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors']
GA-treated activated caspase-3 downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax protein , eventually leading to a decrease in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio in tumor cells .	['resisting cell death']
CONCLUSIONS The antitumor action of GA was due to inhibiting the proliferation in a manner of inhibiting division , retarding the progress of cell cycle and inducing apoptosis , making GA a candidate as new antitumor drug .	[]
