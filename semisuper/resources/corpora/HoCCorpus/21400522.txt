AIMS Angiogenesis from thyroid cancer cell plays the important roles in post-surgical persistent , recurrent , and metastatic papillary thyroid cancer ( PTC ) .	[]
This study is to investigate the expression of angiopoietin-1 ( Ang-1 ) , angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) , Tek/Tie-2 receptor , and vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGF ) in normal , benign thyroid tissues and different stage of PTC .	[]
We expect angiogenetic factors are important in the presentation of local-regional neck or distant metastases in PTC .	[]
MATERIALS AND RESULTS A total of 101 tissues from the subjects underwent thyroidectomy were enrolled in the study .	[]
There were 22 control and 79 thyroid cancer patients in different TNM stagings were collected .	[]
Ang-1 illustrated highest mean immunostaining score in metastatic group .	[]
Comparing with normal and benign thyroid tissues , thyroid cancer tissues illustrated significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor .	[]
Of the PTC , significantly high expression of three angiogenetic factors and Tie-2 receptor were illustrated in recurrent cases .	[]
VEGF showed statistical difference in disease-free cancer mortality , and recurrent groups .	[]
CONCLUSIONS Immunochemical staining illustrated VEGF , Ang-1 , Ang-2 expression in PTC tissues related to clinical staging ; however , we need more information concerning these factors with long-term follow-up results .	['inducing angiogenesis']
