Integrin αvβ3 plays a role in insulin-like growth factor 1 ( IGF1 ) signaling ( integrin-IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R ) cross-talk ) in non-transformed cells in anchorage-dependent conditions .	[]
We reported previously that IGF1 directly binds to αvβ3 and induces αvβ3-IGF1-IGF1R ternary complex formation in these conditions .	[]
The integrin-binding defective IGF1 mutant ( R36E/R37E ) is defective in inducing ternary complex formation and IGF signaling , whereas it still binds to IGF1R .	[]
We studied if IGF1 can induce signaling in anchorage-independent conditions in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells that express αvβ3 ( β3-CHO ) cells .	[]
Here we describe that IGF1 signals were more clearly detectable in anchorage-independent conditions ( polyHEMA-coated plates ) than in anchorage-dependent conditions .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
This suggests that IGF signaling is masked by signals from cell-matrix interaction in anchorage-dependent conditions .	[]
IGF signaling required αvβ3 expression , and R36E/R37E was defective in inducing signals in polyHEMA-coated plates .	[]
These results suggest that αvβ3-IGF1 interaction , not αvβ3-extracellular matrix interaction , is essential for IGF signaling .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Inhibitors of IGF1R , Src , AKT , and ERK1/2 did not suppress αvβ3-IGF-IGF1R ternary complex formation , suggesting that activation of these kinases are not required for ternary complex formation .	[]
Also , mutations of the β3 cytoplasmic tail ( Y747F and Y759F ) that block β3 tyrosine phosphorylation did not affect IGF1R phosphorylation or AKT activation .	['genomic instability and mutation']
We propose a model in which IGF1 binding to IGF1R induces recruitment of integrin αvβ3 to the IGF-IGF1R complex and then β3 and IGF1R are phosphorylated .	[]
It is likely that αvβ3 should be together with the IGF1-IGF1R complex for triggering IGF signaling .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
