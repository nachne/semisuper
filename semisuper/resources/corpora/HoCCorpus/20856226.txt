Cytokeratin ( CK ) 19-positive hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) has been reported to have a poor prognosis .	[]
The mechanism of the development of CK19-positive HCC remains to be studied .	[]
To clarify this , in vitro experiments were performed using human HCC cell lines ( PLC-5 , HepG2 ) , and the phenotypic changes after stimulation with several growth factors were examined using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR , western blotting , and immunofluorescence staining .	[]
In vivo experiments using human HCC specimens obtained from a total of 78 patients and clinicopathological analysis were also performed .	[]
Among the growth factors tested , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) had prominent effects on inducing CK19 expression in PLC-5 and HepG2 , which was accompanied by the reduced expression of Î±-fetoprotein in PLC-5 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The induction of CK19 expression after EGF stimulation was accompanied by the phosphorylation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase ( JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase , which was blocked by the addition of JNK inhibitors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
EGF also increased proliferative abilities and invasive properties of the HCC cell lines .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In vivo , 9 ( 12% ) of 78 HCC cases showed positive immunohistochemical staining of CK19 .	[]
The extent of positive immunohistochemical signals of EGF , EGF receptor ( EGFR ) , and JNK expression was significantly intense in CK-19-positive HCC than those of CK19-negative HCC .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Clinicopathological analysis showed that CK19-positive HCC had a high incidence of portal vein invasion , extrahepatic metastasis and an early relapse , which was associated with the worsened 2-year disease free survival .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
These results indicate that the activation of the EGF-EGFR signaling pathway is associated with the development of CK19-positive HCC , and the EGF-induced increase in growth abilities of HCC may account for the poor prognosis of the patients .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
