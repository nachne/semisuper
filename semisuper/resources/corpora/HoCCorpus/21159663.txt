Melanoma progression is associated with the expression of different growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines .	[]
Because TGFÎ²1 is a pleiotropic cytokine involved not only in physiologic processes but also in cancer development , we analyzed in A375 human melanoma cells , the effect of TGFÎ²1 on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1 ) and interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) expression , two known factors responsible for melanoma progression .	[]
TGFÎ²1 increased the expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 in A375 cells , an effect mediated by the cross-talk between Smad , PI3K ( phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT , and BRAF-MAPK ( mitogen activated protein kinase ) signaling pathways .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Supernatants from TGFÎ²1-treated A375 cells enhanced MCP-1-dependent migration of monocytes , which , in turn , expressed high levels of TGF,Î²1 , bFGF , and VEGF mRNA .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Moreover , these supernatants also inhibited functional properties of dendritic cells through IL-10-dependent mechanisms .	[]
When using in vitro , the TGFÎ²1-blocking peptide P144 , TGFÎ²1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation , and expression of MCP-1 and IL-10 were inhibited .	[]
In vivo , treatment of A375 tumor-bearing athymic mice with P144 significantly reduced tumor growth , associated with a lower macrophage infiltrate and decreased intratumor MCP-1 and VEGF levels , as well as angiogenesis .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Finally , in C57BL/6 mice with B16-OVA melanoma tumors , when administered with immunotherapy , P144 decreased tumor growth and intratumor IL-10 levels , linked to enhanced activation of dendritic cells and natural killer cells , as well as anti-OVA T-cell responses .	[]
These results show new effects of TGFÎ²1 on melanoma cells , which promote tumor progression and immunosuppression , strongly reinforcing the relevance of this cytokine as a molecular target in melanoma .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
