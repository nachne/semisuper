Glycolysis is the initial step of glucose catabolism and is up-regulated in cancer cells ( the Warburg Effect ) .	[]
Such shifts toward a glycolytic phenotype have not been explored widely in other biological systems , and the molecular mechanisms underlying the shifts remain unknown .	[]
With proteomics , we observed increased glycolysis in disused human diaphragm muscle .	[]
In disused muscle , lung cancer , and H(2)O(2)-treated myotubes , we show up-regulation of the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme muscle-type phosphofructokinase ( PFKm , &gt;2 fold , P&lt;0.05 ) and accumulation of lactate ( &gt;150% , P&lt;0.05 ) .	['cellular energetics']
Using microRNA profiling , we identify miR-320a as a regulator of PFKm expression .	[]
Reduced miR-320a levels ( to âˆ¼50% of control , P&lt;0.05 ) are associated with the increased PFKm in each of these diverse systems .	[]
Manipulation of miR-320a levels both in vitro and in vivo alters PFKm and lactate levels in the expected directions .	[]
Further , miR-320a appears to regulate oxidative stress-induced PFKm expression , and reduced miR-320a allows greater induction of glycolysis in response to H(2)O(2) treatment .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'cellular energetics']
We show that this microRNA-mediated regulation occurs through PFKm's 3 ' untranslated region and that Ets proteins are involved in the regulation of PFKm via miR-320a .	[]
These findings suggest that oxidative stress-responsive microRNA-320a may regulate glycolysis broadly within nature .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'cellular energetics']
