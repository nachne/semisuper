Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is still an incurable disease with resistance to therapy developing in the majority of patients .	[]
We investigated the effect of TPEN , an intracellular zinc chelator , in Jurkat and in ex vivo acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) cells resistant to chemotherapy .	[]
Changes of nuclei morphology , reactive oxygen species generation , presence of hypodiploid cells , phosphatidylserine translocation , mitochondrial membrane depolarization , immunohistochemical identification of cell death signalling molecules , and pharmacological inhibition were assayed to detect the apoptotic cell death pathways .	[]
We found that TPEN induces apoptosis in both types of cells by a molecular oxidative stress pathway involving O(2)(â¢-) &gt ; H(2)O(2) &gt ; NF-ÎºB ( JNK/c-Jun ) &gt;p53&gt ; loss ÎÎ¨(m)&gt ; caspase-3 , AIF &gt ; chromatin condensation/DNA fragmentation .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']
Interestingly , TPEN induced apoptosis independently of glucose ; leukemic cells are therefore devoid of survival capacity by metabolic resistance to treatment .	['resisting cell death']
Most importantly , TPEN cytotoxic effect can eventually be regulated by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine and zinc ions .	[]
Our data suggest that TPEN can be used as a potential therapeutic prooxidant agent against refractory leukemia .	[]
These data contribute to understanding the importance of oxidative stress in the treatment of ALL .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
