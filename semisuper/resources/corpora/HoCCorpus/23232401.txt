It is well known that ErbB2 , a receptor tyrosine kinase , localizes to the plasma membrane .	[]
Here we describe a novel observation that ErbB2 also localizes in mitochondria of cancer cells and patient samples .	[]
We found that ErbB2 translocates into mitochondria through association with mtHSP70 .	[]
Additionally , mitochondrial ErbB2 ( mtErbB2 ) negatively regulates mitochondrial respiratory functions .	[]
Oxygen consumption and activities of complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain were decreased in mtErbB2-overexpressing cells .	[]
Mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ATP levels were also decreased .	[]
In contrast , mtErbB2 enhanced cellular glycolysis .	['cellular energetics']
The translocation of ErbB2 and its impact on mitochondrial function are kinase dependent .	[]
Interestingly , cancer cells with higher levels of mtErbB2 were more resistant to the ErbB2-targeting antibody trastuzumab .	[]
Our study provides a novel perspective on the metabolic regulatory function of ErbB2 and reveals that mtErbB2 has an important role in the regulation of cellular metabolism and cancer cell resistance to therapeutics .	['cellular energetics']
