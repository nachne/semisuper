The down-regulation of dominant oncogenes , including C-MYC , in tumor cells often leads to the induction of senescence via mechanisms that are not completely identified .	[]
In the current study , we demonstrate that MYC-depleted melanoma cells undergo extensive DNA damage that is caused by the underexpression of thymidylate synthase ( TS ) and ribonucleotide reductase ( RR ) and subsequent depletion of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Simultaneous genetic inhibition of TS and RR in melanoma cells induced DNA damage and senescence phenotypes very similar to the ones caused by MYC-depletion .	['enabling replicative immortality', 'genomic instability and mutation']
Reciprocally , overexpression of TS and RR in melanoma cells or addition of deoxyribo-nucleosides to culture media substantially inhibited DNA damage and senescence-associated phenotypes caused by C-MYC depletion .	['enabling replicative immortality', 'genomic instability and mutation']
Our data demonstrate the essential role of TS and RR in C-MYC-dependent suppression of senescence in melanoma cells .	['enabling replicative immortality']
