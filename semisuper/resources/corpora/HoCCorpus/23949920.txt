BACKGROUND Yes Associated Protein ( YAP ) has been implicated in the control of organ size by regulating cell proliferation and survival .	[]
YAP is a transcriptional coactivator that controls cellular responses through interaction with TEAD transcription factors in the nucleus , while its transcriptional functions are inhibited by phosphorylation-dependent translocation to the cytosol .	[]
YAP overexpression has been associated with different types of cancer , such as lung , skin , prostate , ovary and liver cancer .	[]
Recently , YAP was linked to E-cadherin-dependent regulation of contact inhibition in breast cancer cells .	[]
RESULTS In this study we examined YAP protein expression and cellular localization in 237 cases of human invasive breast cancer by immunohistochemistry and related its expression to clinicopathological features and E-cadherin expression .	[]
We observed that invasive lobular carcinoma is characterized by higher expression levels of both nuclear and cytosolic YAP ( pâ&lt;â0.001 ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Nuclear YAP expression did not associate with other variables such as lymph node involvement , tumor grade , tumor size , mitotic activity or the molecular sub-types of invasive breast cancer .	[]
We observed that high nuclear and cytosolic YAP expression are associated with the E-cadherin deficient breast cancer subtype ILC ( pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and cell lines derived from human breast cancers and conditional mouse models of human lobular breast cancer .	[]
CONCLUSIONS Since our data indicate that nuclear YAP localization is more common in breast cancers lacking functional adherens junctions , it suggests that YAP-mediated transcription may be involved in the development and progression of invasive lobular breast cancer .	[]
