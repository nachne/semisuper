Nonmelanoma skin cancer ( NMSC ) is by far the most frequent type of cancer in humans .	[]
NMSC includes several types of malignancies with different clinical outcomes , the most frequent being basal and squamous cell carcinomas .	[]
We have used the Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system to identify somatic mutations associated with NMSC .	[]
Transgenic mice bearing multiple copies of a mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon T2Onc2 and expressing the SB11 transposase under the transcriptional control of regulatory elements from the keratin K5 promoter were treated with TPA , either in wild-type or Ha-ras mutated backgrounds .	[]
After several weeks of treatment , mice with transposition developed more malignant tumors with decreased latency compared with control mice .	[]
Transposon/transposase animals also developed basal cell carcinomas .	[]
Genetic analysis of the transposon integration sites in the tumors identified several genes recurrently mutated in different tumor samples , which may represent novel candidate cancer genes .	[]
We observed alterations in the expression levels of some of these genes in human tumors .	[]
Our results show that inactivating mutations in Notch1 and Nsd1 , among others , may have an important role in skin carcinogenesis .	['genomic instability and mutation']
