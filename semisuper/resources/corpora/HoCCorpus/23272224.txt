Cellular senescence is considered as a tumor suppressive mechanism .	[]
Recent evidence indicates however that senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines , some of which may paradoxically promote cancer progression .	[]
This phenomenon termed senescence-associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) must be inhibited in order for anti-proliferative agents to be effective .	[]
The present study was designed to determine whether the Î²-catenin destruction complex ( BCDC ) , known to integrate the action of various growth factors and cytokines , would represent a suitable target to inhibit the activity of SASP components .	[]
For this , we carried out experiments to determine the effect of drug-induced senescence on secretion of SASP , Î²-catenin transactivation , and the relationship between these processes .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Moreover , genetic and pharmacological approaches were used to define the implication of BCDC in mediating the effects of SASP components on cell migration and resistance to drugs .	[]
The findings indicate that drug-induced senescence was associated with expression of various Wnt ligands in addition to previously known SASP components .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Beta catenin transactivation and expression of genes implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) also increased in response to drug-induced SASP .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
These effects were prevented by Pyrvinium , a recently described activator of BCDC .	[]
Pyrvinium also suppressed the effects of SASP on cell migration and resistance to doxorubicin .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Together , these findings provide insights on the potential role of BCDC in mediating the effects of drug-induced SASP on cancer cell invasion and resistance to therapy , and suggest that targeting this pathway may represent an effective approach to enhance the activity of current and prospective anti-cancer therapeutics .
