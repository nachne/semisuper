Bone marrow necrosis ( BMN ) is a rare finding in children with malignancy occurring most commonly in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia .	[]
This article describes the first case of a girl who developed BMN during treatment for Hodgkin's disease .	[]
During the second cycle of chemotherapy , she experienced sudden profound bone pain in the lumbosacral region associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , fibrin degradation products ( D-Dimer ) , and alkaline phosphatase as well as pancytopenia and leukoerythroblastosis .	[]
MRI studies showed multiple confluent areas with low signal intensity and rim contrast enhancement in all vertebral bodies .	[]
Bone marrow biopsy revealed focal necrosis within hypocellular bone marrow .	['resisting cell death']
The patient responded quickly to symptomatic treatment with analgetics and heparin ; however , elevations of LDH and D-Dimer persisted for 1.5 and 8 months , respectively .	[]
Clinicians should be aware of this rare condition to establish the diagnosis and to continue oncologic treatment as early as possible .	[]
