Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) is an anti-inflammatory molecule .	[]
To study its biologic function in myeloid cells , dominant-negative PPARÎ³ ( dnPPARÎ³ ) was overexpressed in a myeloid-specific bitransgenic mouse model .	[]
In this bitransgenic system , overexpression of the dnPPARÎ³-Flag fusion protein in myeloid-lineage cells abnormally elevated frequencies and total numbers of IL-7RÎ±(-)Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(-) , Lin(-)/Scal(+)/c-Kit(+) , common myeloid , and granulocyte-monocyte progenitor populations in the BM. dnPPARÎ³ overexpression led to up-regulation of IL-1Î² , IL-6 , and TNFÎ± in the blood plasma .	[]
As a result , CD11b(+)Ly6G(+) cells were systemically increased in association with activation of Stat3 , NF-ÎºB , Erk1/2 , and p38 molecules .	[]
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) inhibited the proliferation and lymphokine production of wild-type CD4+ T cells in vitro .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
CD4+ T cells from doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice displayed reduced proliferation and lymphokine release .	[]
Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations were decreased in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Multiple forms of carcinoma and sarcoma in the lung , liver , spleen , and lymph nodes were observed in doxycycline-treated bitransgenic mice .	[]
BM transplantation revealed that a myeloid-autonomous defect was responsible for MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and tumorigenesis in these mice .	[]
These studies suggest that anti-inflammatory PPARÎ³ in myeloid-lineage cells plays a key role in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokine synthesis , MDSC expansion , immunosuppression , and the development of cancer .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
