Melanoma cells express and interact with laminins ( LMs ) and other basement membrane components during invasion and metastasis .	[]
In the present study we have investigated the production and migration-promoting activity of laminin isoforms in melanoma .	[]
Immunohistochemistry of melanoma specimens and immunoprecipitation/western blotting of melanoma cell lines indicated expression of laminin-111/121 , laminin-211 , laminin-411/421 , and laminin-511/521 .	[]
Laminin-332 was not detected .	[]
In functional assays , laminin-111 , laminin-332 , and laminin-511 , but not laminin-211 and laminin-411 , strongly promoted haptotactic cell migration either constitutively or following stimulation with insulin-like growth factors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Both placenta and recombinant laminin-511 preparations were highly active , and the isolated recombinant IVa domain of LMÎ±5 also promoted cell migration .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Function-blocking antibodies in cell migration assays revealed Î±6Î²1 integrin as the major receptor for laminin-111 , and both Î±3Î²1 and Î±6Î²1 integrins for laminin-332 and laminin-511 .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In contrast , isolated LMÎ±5 IVa domain-promoted melanoma cell migration was largely mediated via Î±VÎ²3 integrin and inhibited by RGD peptides .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Given the ubiquitous expression of Î±5 laminins in melanoma cells and in melanoma-target tissues/anatomical structures , as well as the strong migration-promoting activity of these laminin isoforms , the Î±5 laminins emerge as putative primary extracellular matrix mediators of melanoma invasion and metastasis via Î±3Î²1 and other integrin receptors .
