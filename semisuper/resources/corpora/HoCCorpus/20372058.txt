Although contact inhibition is a fundamental process for multicellular organisms , how proliferation is inhibited at high cellular densities remains poorly characterized .	[]
Here we show that 4E-BP1 , one major repressor of cap-dependent translation , plays a critical role in density-mediated cell cycle arrest. 4E-BP1 promoter is activated and 4E-BP1 protein amount increases as cells reach confluence .	[]
Conversely , a much less marked density-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is observed upon 4E-BP1 silencing .	[]
We further show that at high density , progression through the Gâ phase of the cell cycle is faster and Cyclin D1 protein is induced in different cell types where 4E-BP1 has been either downregulated ( stable shRNA expression or transient siRNA transfection ) or removed ( knock-out ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Thus 4E-BP1 appears as an important mediator of contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
