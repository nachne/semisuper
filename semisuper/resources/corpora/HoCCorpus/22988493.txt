The molecular mechanism mediating expression of senescent cell antigen-aggregated or cleaved band 3 and externalized phosphatidylserine ( PS ) on the surface of aged erythrocytes and their premature expression in certain anemias is not completely elucidated .	[]
The erythrocytes with these surface modifications undergo macrophage-mediated phagocytosis .	[]
In this study , the role of protein kinase C ( PKC ) isoforms in the expression of these surface modifications was investigated .	[]
Inhibition of PKC Î± by 30âÎ¼M rottlerin ( R30 ) and 2.3ânM Gï¿½ 6976 caused expression of both the senescent cell marker-externalized PS measured by FACS analysis and aggregated band 3 detected by western blotting .	['enabling replicative immortality']
In contrast to this observation , but in keeping with literature , PKC activation by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate ( PMA ) also led to the expression of senescence markers .	['enabling replicative immortality']
We explain this antithesis by demonstrating that PMA-treated cells show reduction in the activity of PKC Î± , thereby simulating inhibition .	[]
The reduction in PKC Î± activity may be attributed to the known downregulation of PMA-activated PKC Î± , caused by its membrane translocation and proteolysis .	[]
We demonstrate membrane translocation of PKC Î± in PMA-treated cells to substantiate this inference .	[]
Thus loss of PKC Î± activity either by inhibition or downregulation can cause surface modifications which can trigger erythrophagocytosis .	[]
