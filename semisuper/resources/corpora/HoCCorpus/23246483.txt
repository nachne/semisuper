DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) representa serious threat for hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) .	[]
How cytokines and environmental signals integrate the DNA damage response and contribute to HSC-intrinsic DNA repair processes remains unknown .	[]
Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) and its receptor , Mpl , are critical factors supporting HSC self-renewal and expansion .	[]
Here , we uncover an unknown function for TPO-Mpl in the regulation of DNA damage response .	['genomic instability and mutation']
We show that DNA repair following γ-irradiation ( γ-IR ) or the action of topoisomerase-II inhibitors is defective in Mpl(-/-) and in wild-type mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells treated in the absence of TPO .	['genomic instability and mutation']
TPO stimulates DNA repair invitro and invivo by increasing DNA-PK-dependent nonhomologous end-joining efficiency .	['genomic instability and mutation']
This ensures HSC chromosomal integrity and limits their long-term injury in response to IR.This shows that niche factors can modulate theHSC DSB repair machinery and opens new avenues for administration of TPO agonists for minimizing radiotherapy-induced HSC injury and mutagenesis .	[]
