Estrogens play essential roles in the progression of mammary and prostatic diseases .	[]
The transcriptional effects of estrogens are transduced by two estrogen receptors , ERÎ± and ERÎ² , which elicit opposing roles in regulating proliferation : ERÎ± is proliferative while ERÎ² is anti-proliferative .	[]
Exogenous expression of ERÎ² in ERÎ±-positive cancer cell lines inhibits cell proliferation in response to estrogen and reduces xenografted tumor growth in vivo , suggesting that ERÎ² might oppose ERÎ±'s proliferative effects via formation of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers .	[]
Despite biochemical and cellular evidence of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer formation in cells co-expressing both receptors , the biological roles of the ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer remain to be elucidated .	[]
Here we report the identification of two phytoestrogens that selectively activate ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers at specific concentrations using a cell-based , two-step high throughput small molecule screen for ER transcriptional activity and ER dimer selectivity .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Using ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer-selective ligands at defined concentrations , we demonstrate that ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers are growth inhibitory in breast and prostate cells which co-express the two ER isoforms .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , using Automated Quantitative Analysis ( AQUA ) to examine nuclear expression of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in human breast tissue microarrays , we demonstrate that ERÎ± and ERÎ² are co-expressed in the same cells in breast tumors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The co-expression of ERÎ± and ERÎ² in the same cells supports the possibility of ERÎ±/Î² heterodimer formation at physio- and pathological conditions , further suggesting that targeting ERÎ±/Î² heterodimers might be a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of cancers which co-express ERÎ± and ERÎ² .
