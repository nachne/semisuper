A panel of primary human cells and virus-transformed derivatives were tested for events that coincide with immortalization .	[]
In all primary and precrisis cells , two proteins of 92 and 150 kDa that shared an epitope with p53 were found ; in most of their immortalized derivatives , however , they were absent .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Expression of these proteins may be involved in senescence .	['enabling replicative immortality']
