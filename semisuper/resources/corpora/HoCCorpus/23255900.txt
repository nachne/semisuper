Cancer immunotherapies are designed to elicit T-cell responses that inhibit tumor growth .	[]
Previous studies have demonstrated that interleukin 21 ( IL-21 ) is a promising cytokine for cancer immunotherapy due to its ability to induce the immunity of T cells and natural killer cells , whereas blockade of the interaction of programmed death receptor-1 ( PD-1 ) with its ligand ( PD-L1 ) reduces peripheral tolerance .	[]
In the current study , we investigated IL-21 alone and in combination with soluble PD-1 ( sPD-1 ) for the treatment of experimental H22 murine hepatocarcinoma .	[]
The naked plasmids pmIL-21 and/or psPD-1 were used for local gene transfer by injection .	[]
In these assays , sPD-1 combined with IL-21 was found to significantly inhibit the growth of the tumors in mice .	[]
Combined treatment with IL-21 and sPD-1 enhanced the antitumor immune response compared with that induced by IL-21 alone .	['avoiding immune destruction']
Combined treatment was found to increase CTL cytotoxicity , increase the number of CTLs and NK cells in splenocytes , upregulate the cytokines IFN-Î³ and IL-2 and downregulate IL-10 .	[]
Thus , immunotherapy with IL-21 in combination with sPD-1 was found to induce a more efficacious antitumor immune response , which may have potential clinical implications .	['avoiding immune destruction']
