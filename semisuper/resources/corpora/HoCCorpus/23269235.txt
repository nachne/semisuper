Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that mainly targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors , and recently , it has been shown to be an active agent for the treatment of malignant pheochromocytomas .	[]
Previously , we demonstrated that sunitinib directly inhibited mTORC1 signaling in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells .	[]
Although autophagy is a highly regulated cellular process , its relevance to cancer seems to be complicated .	[]
It is of note that inhibition of mTORC1 is a prerequisite for autophagy induction .	[]
Indeed , direct mTORC1 inhibition initiates ULK1/2 autophosphorylation and subsequent Atg13 and FIP200 phosphorylation , inducing autophagy .	[]
Here , we demonstrated that sunitinib significantly increased the levels of LC3-II , concomitant with a decrease of p62 in PC12 cells .	[]
Following sunitinib treatment , immunofluorescent imaging revealed a marked increased punctate LC3-II distribution .	[]
Furthermore , Atg13 knockdown significantly reduced its protein level , which in turn abolished sunitinib-induced autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
Moreover , inhibition of autophagy by siRNAs targeting Atg13 or by pharmacological inhibition with ammonium chloride , enhanced both sunitinib-induced apoptosis and anti-proliferation .	['resisting cell death']
Thus , sunitinib-induced autophagy is dependent on the suppression of mTORC1 signaling and the formation of ULK1/2-Atg13-FIP200 complexes .	['resisting cell death']
Inhibition of autophagy may be a promising therapeutic option for improving the anti-tumor effect of sunitinib .	['resisting cell death']
