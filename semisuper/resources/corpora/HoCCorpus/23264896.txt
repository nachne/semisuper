Inflammation is a major risk factor for carcinogenesis in patients affected by chronic colitis , yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression from chronic inflammation to cancer are not completely understood .	[]
Activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4)-NFÎºB signaling axis is associated with inflammation .	[]
Thus , we hypothesized that inhibition of TLR4-NFÎºB signaling might help in limiting inflammatory responses and inflammation-induced oncogenesis .	[]
In this work , we studied the effects of a TLR4-interacting surfactant protein A-derived ( SPA4 ) peptide on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS)-induced TLR4-NFÎºB signaling and cancer progression .	[]
We first characterized this peptide for its ability to bind the TLR4 ligand-LPS and for physico-chemical characteristics .	[]
Inflammation was induced by challenging the colon cancer SW480 cells with Escherichia coli LPS .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Cells were then treated with varying amounts of the SPA4 peptide .	[]
Changes in the expression of TLR4 , interleukin ( IL)-1Î² and IL-6 , in intracellular NFÎºB-related signal transducers ( IKBÎ± , p65 , phosphorylated IKBÎ± , phosphorylated p65 , RelB , COX-2 ) as well as in the transcriptional activity of NFÎºB were studied by immunocytochemistry , immunoblotting and NFÎºB reporter assay , respectively .	[]
Simultaneously , the effects on LPS-induced cell migration and invasion were determined .	[]
We found that the SPA4 peptide does not bind to LPS .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Rather , its binding to TLR4 inhibits the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p65 , production of IL-1Î² and IL-6 , activity of NFÎºB , migration and invasion of SW480 cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In conclusion , our results suggest that the inhibition of TLR4-NFÎºB signaling by a TLR4-binding peptide may help for the treatment of chronic inflammation and prevention of inflammation-induced cancer in patients with colitis .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
