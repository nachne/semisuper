Purpose .	[]
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate a new PET tracer ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) for imaging of tumor angiogenesis using gene expression of angiogenesis markers as reference and to estimate radiation dosimetry for humans .	[]
Procedures .	[]
Nude mice with human neuroendocrine tumor xenografts ( H727 ) were administered ( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) i.v. for study of biodistribution as well as for dynamic PET .	[]
Gene expression of angiogenesis markers integrin Î±(V) , integrin Î²(3) , and VEGF-A were analyzed using QPCR and correlated to the tracer uptake in the tumors ( %ID/g ) .	[]
From biodistribution data human radiation-absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM .	[]
Results .	[]
Tumor uptake was 1.2%ID/g with strong correlations between gene expression and tracer uptake , for integrin Î±(V)âR = 0.76 , integrin Î²(3)âR = 0.75 and VEGF-A R = 0.81 ( all P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
The whole body effective dose for humans was estimated to be 0.038 and 0.029âmSv/MBq for females and males , respectively , with highest absorbed dose in bladder wall .	[]
Conclusion .	[]
( 64)Cu-NODAGA-c(RGDyK ) is a promising new angiogenesis PET tracer with potential for human use .	['inducing angiogenesis']
