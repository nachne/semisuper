Oncogene-induced senescence is now recognized as being an important mechanism in protecting against cancer .	[]
The phenotypic consequences , i.e. , the inhibition of cell proliferation , are well described in model systems and specific events/key players defined .	[]
However , there is still the need to understand , at a more global level , the network of events involved both in terms of cause and consequence .	[]
This paper shows the power of systematic proteomic analyses , both targeted and global , in addressing such biological questions , highlighting the widespread nature of histone acetylation changes , and the opposite metabolic changes to those seen in the Warburg effect .	['cellular energetics']
