Background .	[]
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) , an almost incurable disease , is the second most common blood cancer .	[]
Initial chemotherapeutic treatment could be successful ; however , resistance development urges the use of higher toxic doses accompanied by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .	[]
The establishment of more effective treatments that can overcome or circumvent chemoresistance has become a priority .	[]
We recently demonstrated that venom extracted from Walterinnesia aegyptia ( WEV ) either alone or in combination with silica nanoparticles ( WEV+NPs ) mediated the growth arrest and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells .	[]
In the present study , we evaluated the impact of WEV alone and WEV+NP on proliferation and apoptosis of MM cells .	[]
Methods .	[]
The impacts of WEV alone and WEV+NP were monitored in MM cells from 70 diagnosed patients .	[]
The influences of WEV and WEV+NP were assessed with flow cytometry analysis .	[]
Results .	[]
WEV alone and WEV+NP decreased the viability of MM cells .	[]
Using a CFSE proliferation assay , we found that WEV+NP strongly inhibited MM cell proliferation .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , analysis of the cell cycle using the propidium iodide ( PI ) staining method indicated that WEV+NP strongly altered the cell cycle of MM cells and enhanced the induction of apoptosis .	['resisting cell death', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Conclusions .	[]
Our data reveal the biological effects of WEV and WEV+NP on MM cells that enable these compounds to function as effective treatments for MM .	[]
