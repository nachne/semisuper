Diallyl disulfide ( DADS ) is a major organo-sulfur compound derived from garlic ( Allium sativum ) , which inhibits the proliferation of various types of cancer cells .	[]
In this study we investigated the effect of DADS on the induction of apoptosis , as well as its regulatory effect on the activation of transcription factors in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	[]
Treatment of B16F-10 cells with nontoxic concentrations of DADS resulted in the presence of apoptotic bodies and induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependent manner .	['resisting cell death']
Cell-cycle analysis revealed that the occurrence of the sub-G1 peak was significantly elevated in DADS-treated cells .	[]
DADS treatment also down-reguated Bcl-2 expression and up-regulated p53 , caspase-9 , and caspase-3 expression in B16F-10 melanoma cells .	['resisting cell death']
The study also reveals that DADS inhibited the activation and nuclear translocation of p65 , p50 , and c-Rel subunits of nuclear factor ( NF)-B and other transcription factors , such as c-fos , activated transcription factor-2 , and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein , in B16F-10 melanoma cells The pro-inflammatory cytokine production and gene expression of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-Î± , interleukin ( IL)-1Î² , IL-6 , and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) were down-regulated in DADS-treated cells compared with control B16F-10 metastatic melanoma cells .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
DADS induces caspase-dependent apoptosis through a mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway in B16F-10 melanoma cells by activating p53 and caspase-3 gene expression and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and NF-B-mediated Bcl-2 activation .
