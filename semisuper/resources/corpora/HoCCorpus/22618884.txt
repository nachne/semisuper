Breast cancer consists in a chronic inflammatory disease with multiple biological and clinical behaviors .	[]
Based on high throughput technologies data , this disease is currently classified according to the molecular expression of estrogen ( ER ) , progesterone ( PR ) and human epidermal growth factor ( HER-2 ) receptors .	[]
In this study , we defined the inflammatory profile of the main molecular subtypes of breast cancer patients : luminal ( ER and PR positive , HER-2 negative ) , HER-2 enriched ( HER-2 positive ) and triple negative ( ER , PR and HER-2 negative ) .	[]
Cytokines panel was assessed by measurement of TNF-Î± , TGF-Î² , IL-1 , IL-10 and IL-12 plasmatic levels .	[]
Oxidative profile was assessed by determination of lipid peroxidation , total antioxidant capacity of plasma , malondialdehyde levels , carbonyl content and nitric oxide ( NO ) .	[]
Clinical data were correlated with inflammatory findings .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Our findings demonstrated that patients bearing the luminal subtype displayed high TNF-Î± , TGF-Î² and enhanced oxidative stress levels associated with reduced IL-12 .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
HER-2-enriched group exhibited higher levels of TNF-Î± , IL-12 and TGF-Î² associated with enhanced oxidative stress .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Triple-negative subtype exhibited the most aggressive profile of disease behavior , with reduction in both TNF-Î± and TGF-Î² , with high levels of lipid peroxidation and NO .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
The clinical importance of our findings lies in the fact that the inflammatory status varies in distinct ways due to molecular subtype of breast cancer , opening potential therapeutic targets to future therapies .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
