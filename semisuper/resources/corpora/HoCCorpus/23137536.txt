We previously demonstrated that downregulation of protein kinase CKII induces cellular senescence in human colon cancer HCT116 cells .	[]
To investigate the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in CKII downregulation during senescence , we employed computational algorithms .	[]
Four miRNAs ( miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 ) were predicted to be miRNAs against CKIIÎ± mRNA .	[]
Mimics of all four miRNAs jointly downregulated CKIIÎ± expression in HCT116 cells .	[]
Reporter analysis and RT-PCR have suggested that these four miRNAs may stimulate degradation of CKIIÎ± mRNA by targeting its 3 ' untranslated regions ( UTRs ) .	[]
The four miRNA mimics increased senescent-associated Î²-galactosidase ( SA-Î²-gal ) staining , p53 and p21(Cip1/WAF1) expression , and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'enabling replicative immortality']
In contrast , concomitant knockdown of the four miRNAs by antisense inhibitors increased the CKIIÎ± protein level and suppressed CKII inhibition-mediated senescence .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Finally , CKIIÎ± overexpression antagonized senescence induced by the four miRNA mimics .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Therefore , the present results show that miR-186 , miR-216b , miR-337-3p , and miR-760 cooperatively promote cellular senescence through the p53-p21(Cip1/WAF1) pathway by CKII downregulation-mediated ROS production in HCT116 cells .
