A novel compound 2-arylidene-4,7-dimethyl indan-1-one synthesized was screened for anticancer effect against the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line , MCF-7 .	[]
An IC50 value of &gt ; or = 80 microM , nontoxic to the normal breast cell line HBL-100 , showed complete inhibition of the MCF-7 cells .	[]
Analysis of mechanisms showed nuclear fragmentation and DNA laddering in gel electrophoresis .	['resisting cell death']
GSH and GR levels were found to be reduced after the compound treatment .	['resisting cell death']
Cell cycle analysis using fluorescent cytometry revealed G2/M phase arrest , which indicates the compound deserves consideration for further studies against cancer .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
