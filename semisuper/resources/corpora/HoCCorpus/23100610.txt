OBJECTIVE To evaluate the risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis and validate the value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for the prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer patients .	[]
METHODS A sentinel lymph node biopsy database containing 1227 consecutive breast cancer patients ( 416 patients with at least one positive sentinel lymph node ) was retrospectively analyzed .	[]
The predictive value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram was calculated by the trend line and the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve .	[]
Meanwhile , predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis were also evaluated .	[]
RESULTS Tumor size , histological grade , lymphovascular invasion , mulifocality , estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status were significant independent predictors for sentinel lymph node metastasis ( all P&lt;0.01 ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram presented an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve value of 0.730 .	[]
Patients with predictive value&lt;16% had a frequency of sentinel lymph node metastasis of 0.9% .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Those with values larger than 70% had a frequency of 96.2% .	[]
CONCLUSIONS The risk factors for sentinel lymph node metastasis in our study were consistent with those in the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center nomogram is a useful tool that could accurately predict the probability of sentinel lymph node metastasis in our breast cancer patients .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Axillary surgical staging might be avoided in patients with a predictive value of &lt;16% and axillary lymph node dissection might be done directly in those with a predictive value &gt;70% , while other patients should still accept sentinel lymph node biopsy .	[]
