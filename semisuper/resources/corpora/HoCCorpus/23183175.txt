That a knock-in mouse harboring a dominant-negative thyroid hormone receptor ( TR)-Î² ( Thrb ) mutation develops metastatic thyroid cancer strongly suggests the involvement of TRÎ² in carcinogenesis .	[]
Epigenetic silencing of the THRB gene is common in human cancers .	[]
The aim of the present study was to determine how DNA methylation affected the expression of the THRB gene in differentiated thyroid cancer ( DTC ) and how reexpression of the THRB gene attenuated the cancer phenotypes .	[]
We used methylation-specific PCR to examine the expression and promoter methylation of the THRB gene in DTC tissues .	[]
Thyroid cancer cells with hypermethylated THRB were treated with the demethylating agents 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5'-aza-CdR ) and zebularine to evaluate their impact on the cancer cell phenotypes .	[]
THRB mRNA expression in DTC was 90% lower than in normal controls , and this decrease was associated with a higher tumor/lymph node staging .	[]
The promoter methylation level of the THRB gene had a significant negative correlation with the expression level of the THRB gene .	[]
Treatment of FTC-236 cells with 5'-aza-CdR or zebularine induced reexpression of the THRB gene and inhibited cell proliferation and migration .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
FTC-236 cells stably expressing TRÎ² exhibited lower cell proliferation and migration through inhibition of Î²-catenin signaling pathways compared with FTC-236 without TRÎ². 5'-Aza-CdR also led to suppression of tumor growth in an in vivo xenograft model using FTC-236 cells consistent with the cell-based studies .	[]
These finding indicate that TRÎ² is a tumor suppressor and could be tested as a potential therapeutic target .	[]
