The omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , elicit antiproliferative effects in cancer cell lines and in animal models .	[]
Dietary DHA and EPA can be converted to their ethanolamine derivatives , docosahexaenoyl ethanolamine ( DHEA ) and eicosapentaenoyl ethanolamine ( EPEA ) , respectively ; however , few studies are reported on their anticancer activities .	[]
Here , we demonstrated that DHEA and EPEA were able to reduce cell viability in MCF-7 breast cancer cells whereas they did not elicit any effects in MCF-10A non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells .	[]
Since DHA and EPA are ligands of Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor ( PPAR ) Î³ , we sought to determine whether PPARÎ³ may also mediate DHEA and EPEA actions .	[]
In MCF-7 cells , both compounds enhanced PPARÎ³ expression , stimulated a PPAR response element-dependent transcription as confirmed by the increased expression of its target gene PTEN , resulting in the inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathways .	[]
Besides , DHEA and EPEA treatment induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 promoting its dissociation from beclin-1 which resulted in autophagy induction .	['resisting cell death']
We also observed an increase of beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 expression along with an enhanced autophagosomes formation as revealed by mono-dansyl-cadaverine staining .	['resisting cell death']
Finally , we demonstrated the involvement of PPARÎ³ in DHEA- and EPEA-induced autophagy by using siRNA technology and a selective inhibitor .	['resisting cell death']
In summary , our data show that the two omega-3 ethanolamines exert antiproliferative effects by inducing autophagy in breast cancer cells highlighting their potential use as breast cancer preventive and/or therapeutic agents .	['resisting cell death']
