AMPK is a metabolic sensor that helps maintain cellular energy homeostasis .	[]
Despite evidence linking AMPK with tumor suppressor functions , the role of AMPK in tumorigenesis and tumor metabolism isunknown .	[]
Here we show that AMPK negatively regulates aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) in cancer cells and suppresses tumor growth invivo .	['cellular energetics']
Genetic ablation of the α1 catalytic subunit of AMPK accelerates Myc-induced lymphomagenesis .	[]
Inactivation of AMPKα in both transformed and nontransformed cells promotes a metabolic shift to aerobic glycolysis , increased allocation of glucose carbon into lipids , and biomass accumulation .	['cellular energetics']
These metabolic effects require normoxic stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α ( HIF-1α ) , as silencing HIF-1α reverses the shift to aerobic glycolysis and the biosynthetic and proliferative advantages conferred by reduced AMPKα signaling .	['cellular energetics']
Together our findings suggest that AMPK activity opposes tumor development and that its loss fosters tumor progression in part by regulating cellular metabolic pathways that support cell growth and proliferation .	[]
