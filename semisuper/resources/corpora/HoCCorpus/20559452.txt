Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive cancer with a greater than 95% mortality rate and short survival after diagnosis .	[]
Chemotherapeutic resistance hinders successful treatment .	[]
This resistance is often associated with mutations in codon 12 of the K-Ras gene ( K-Ras 12 ) , which is present in over 90% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas .	[]
Codon 12 mutations maintain Ras in a constitutively active state leading to continuous cellular proliferation .	[]
Our study determined if TRAIL resistance in pancreatic adenocarcinomas with K-Ras 12 mutations could be overcome by first sensitizing the cells with Benzyl isothiocyanate ( BITC ) .	[]
BITC is a component of cruciferous vegetables and a cell cycle inhibitor .	[]
BxPC3 , MiaPaCa2 and Panc-1 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were examined for TRAIL resistance .	[]
Our studies show BITC induced TRAIL sensitization by dual activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways .	['resisting cell death']
