OBJECTIVES The aim of this study is to examine the expression of MCM-2 and conventional proliferation marker Ki-67 in breast carcinoma by stereologic technique and to compare it with various clinicopathologic parameters .	[]
METHODS The expression of MCM-2 and Ki-67 on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections of patients with invasive breast carcinoma was analyzed immunohistochemically .	[]
Stereologic method was used for evaluation of the percentage of positively stained tumor cells .	[]
RESULTS Significant positive correlation was found between the expression of MCM-2 and that of Ki-67 ( r = 0.74 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
MCM-2 and Ki-67 expression was significantly associated with histologic grade ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) , and negative correlation was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and estrogen status ( p &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
No significant association was observed between MCM-2 or Ki-67 expression and patient age , tumor size , lymph node status , clinical stage and menopausal status .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSION Our results suggest that MCM-2 expression is significantly associated with histologic grade of breast carcinoma and with cell proliferation capacity ( Ki-67 labelling index ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Additional studies are required using the stereologic method to compare and understand the utility of Ki-67 and MCM-2 expression in invasive breast carcinoma ( Tab. 1 , Fig. 4 , Ref. 34 ) .	[]
