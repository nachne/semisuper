Luteolin is a plant flavonoid which exhibits anti-oxidative , anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor effects .	[]
However , the antiproliferative potential of luteolin is not fully understood .	[]
In this study , we investigated the effect of luteolin on cell cycling and apoptosis in human esophageal squamous carcinoma cell line Eca109 cells .	[]
MTT assays showed that luteolin had obvious cytotoxicity on Eca109 with an IC50 of 70.7ï¿½1.72 Î¼M at 24 h .	[]
Luteolin arrested cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and prevented entry into S phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner. as assessed by FCM .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Luteolin induced apoptosis of Eca109 cells was demonstrated by AO/EB staining assay and annexin V-FITC/PI staining .	['resisting cell death']
Moreover , luteolin downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 , survivin and c-myc , and it also upregulated the expression of p53 , in line with the fact that luteolin was able to inhibit Eca109 cell proliferation .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
