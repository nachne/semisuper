Low-dose cyclophosphamide ( CP ) therapy induces immunogenic tumor cell death and decreases regulatory T cell ( Treg ) numbers in mice with transplantable tumors .	[]
Using the ret transgenic murine melanoma model that resembles human melanoma , we detected no beneficial antitumor effects with such treatment , despite a decrease in Tregs .	[]
On the contrary , low-dose CP enhanced the production of chronic inflammatory mediators in melanoma lesions associated with increased accumulation of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) , which exhibit elevated suppressive activity and nitric oxide ( NO ) production as well as inhibition of T-cell proliferation .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Moreover , the frequencies of CD8(+) T cells in the tumors and their ability to produce perforin were decreased .	[]
To study whether the observed CP-induced MDSC expansion and activation also occurs under chronic inflammatory tumor-free conditions , mice exhibiting chronic inflammation were treated with CP .	[]
Similar to tumor-bearing mice , CP-treated inflamed mice displayed elevated levels of MDSCs with enhanced production of NO , reactive oxygen species , and a suppressed in vivo natural killer ( NK ) cell cytotoxic activity indicating CP effects on the host immune system independent of the tumor .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
We suggest that melanoma therapy with low-dose CP could be efficient only when combined with the neutralization of MDSC immunosuppressive function and chronic inflammatory microenvironment.Journal of Investigative Dermatology advance online publication , 6 December 2012 ; doi:10.1038/jid.2012.444 .
