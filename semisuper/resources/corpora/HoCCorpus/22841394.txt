Liver cancer , predominantly hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , represents a complex and fatal malignancy driven primarily by oxidative stress and inflammation .	[]
Due to dismal prognosis and limited therapeutic intervention , chemoprevention has emerged as a viable approach to reduce the morbidity and mortality of HCC .	[]
Pomegranate fruit is a rich source of phytochemicals endowed with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties .	[]
We previously reported that pomegranate phytochemicals inhibit diethylnitrosamine ( DENA)-initiated hepatocarcinogenesis in rats though nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant mechanisms .	[]
Since Nrf2 also acts as a key mediator of the nuclear factor-kappaB ( NF-ÎºB)-regulated inflammatory pathway , our present study investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of a pomegranate emulsion ( PE ) during DENA-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis .	[]
Rats were administered with PE ( 1 or 10 g/kg ) 4 weeks before and 18 weeks following DENA initiation .	[]
There was a significant increase in hepatic expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase , 3-nitrotyrosine , heat shock protein 70 and 90 , cyclooxygenase-2 and NF-ÎºB in DENA-exposed rat livers .	[]
PE dose-dependently suppressed all aforementioned elevated inflammatory markers .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
A conspicuous finding of this study involves lack of cardiotoxicity of PE as assessed by monitoring cardiac function using noninvasive echocardiography .	[]
Our results provide substantial evidence that suppression of the inflammatory cascade through modulation of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway may represent a novel mechanism of liver tumor inhibitory effects of PE against experimental hepatocarcinogenesis .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Data presented here coupled with those of our earlier study underline the importance of simultaneously targeting two interconnected molecular circuits , namely , Nrf2-mediated redox signaling and NF-ÎºB-regulated inflammatory pathway , by pomegranate phytoconstituents to achieve chemoprevention of HCC .
