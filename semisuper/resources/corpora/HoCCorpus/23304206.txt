Retinoic acid ( RA ) has been believed to be an anticancer drug for a long history .	[]
However , the molecular mechanisms of RA actions on cancer cells remain diverse .	[]
In this study , the dose-dependent inhibition of RA on DU145 cell proliferation was identified .	[]
Interestingly , RA treatment triggered p35 cleavage ( p25 formation ) and Cdk5 overactivation , and all could be blocked by Calpain inhibitor , Calpeptin ( CP ) .	[]
Subsequently , RA-triggered DU145 apoptosis detected by sub-G1 phase accumulation and Annexin V staining could also be blocked by CP treatment .	['resisting cell death']
Furthermore , RA-triggered caspase 3 activation and following Cdk5 over-activation were destroyed by treatments of both CP and Cdk5 knockdown .	['resisting cell death']
In conclusion , we report a new mechanism in which RA could cause apoptosis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells through p35 cleavage and Cdk5 over-activation .	['resisting cell death']
This finding may contribute to constructing a clearer image of RA function and bring RA as a valuable chemoprevention agent for prostate cancer patients .	[]
