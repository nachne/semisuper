OBJECTIVES Human neutrophil proteins-1 , -2 , and -3 ( HNPs -1 , -2 , and -3 ) are expressed in several tumor types .	[]
However , the role of HNPs 1-3 in human bladder cancer has not yet been determined .	[]
We investigated the association between the plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 and clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer patients .	[]
DESIGN AND METHODS The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were measured in 60 patients with bladder cancer and in 58 healthy controls .	[]
The plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 were determined by a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) .	[]
Plasma samples were obtained before surgery .	[]
Plasma samples were permitted to clot and were then stored at -80 ï¿½C until use .	[]
RESULTS The levels of the HNPs increased from grade 1 to 4 tumors and this difference was statistically significant ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	[]
Additionally , plasma HNP levels were significantly higher in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and in patients with lymphovascular involvement , metastasis of the lymph nodes , and increased tumor burden ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS The preoperative plasma levels of HNPs 1-3 paralleled the progression and pathological stages of the malignancies .	[]
This study suggests that HNPs 1-3 promote tumor invasion and are potential indicators of disease progression in patients with bladder cancer .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
