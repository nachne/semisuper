Our purpose in this randomized , double blind , placebo controlled study was to find out the possible effect of a polyphenolic pine bark extract , PycnogenolÂ® ( Pyc ) on the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine ( 8-oxoG ) as representative of oxidative damage to DNA and on the DNA repair ability of elderly people .	[]
According to our results , three months of Pyc administration had no effect on the level of oxidative damage to DNA or on repair ability , but we found a relationship between the level of 8-oxoG and repair ability of DNA in this group .	['genomic instability and mutation']
To conclude , even if the positive effect of Pyc was not confirmed in the case of elderly people it is important to highlight the necessity of further investigations about the mechanisms of Pyc acting on different age groups .	[]
