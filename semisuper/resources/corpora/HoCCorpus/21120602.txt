The role of estrogen receptor beta ( ERÎ² ) in breast cancer is unclear .	[]
ERÎ² is considered to have a protective role in breast cancer development based on findings demonstrating that ERÎ² expression inhibits ERÎ±-mediated proliferation of breast cancer cells .	[]
We previously demonstrated that ERÎ² causes a ligand independent G2 cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells .	[]
To study the mechanisms of the ERÎ²-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest , we investigated its effects on the regulatory pathways responsible for the G2/M phase transition .	[]
We found that ERÎ² inhibits CDK1 activity , which is the critical determinant of the G2/M progression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
CDK1 activity is modulated by both stimulatory and inhibitory factors .	[]
Cyclin B1 is the major activator of CDK1 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
ERÎ² inhibited the cell cycle-dependent stimulation of cyclin B1 mRNA and protein .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
GADD45A and BTG2 are two major inhibitors of CDK1 , which have been implicated in breast tumor formation .	[]
Based on these findings , we explored if the expression pattern of GADD45A and BTG2 is affected by ERÎ² .	[]
We found that ERÎ² stimulates GADD45A and BTG2 mRNA levels .	[]
The induction of these two genes is caused by ERÎ² binding directly to these genes and recruiting c-jun and NCOA2 .	[]
Our findings demonstrated that unliganded ERÎ² causes a G2 cell cycle arrest by inactivating CDK1 through the repression of cyclin B1 and stimulation of GADD45A and BTG2 expression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These results provide evidence that drugs that stimulate the production of unliganded ERÎ² may be effective new therapies to prevent breast cancer .	[]
