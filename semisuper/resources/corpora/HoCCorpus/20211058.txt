OBJECTIVE To study the effects of genistein on the proliferation , apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of human colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo , and its mechanisms of action .	[]
METHODS MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect the effects of genistein on the proliferation of human colon adenocarcinoma SW480 cells .	[]
Light and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the histological and ultrastructural changes .	[]
Flow cytometry was used to determine the effects of genistein on cell cycle and apoptosis .	[]
Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the effects of genistein on apoptosis induction and expression of related gene proteins of colon cancer cells .	[]
RESULTS The MTT colorimetric assay showed that genistein inhibited the proliferation of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner , and the highest inhibition rate was 60.2% after 80 microg/ml genistein treatment for 72 h .	[]
The light microscopy revealed that many genistein-treated cancer cells were shrunken , disrupted , or showing cytoplasmic vacuolization .	[]
The electron microscopic examination showed cell shrinkage , nuclear fragmentation and pronounced chromatin condensation , sometimes formed crescent chromatin condensation attached to the nuclear membrane .	['resisting cell death']
The results of flow cytometry showed that : after SW480 cells were treated with 0 , 20 , 40 , 80 microg/ml genistein for 48 h , the FI values of PCNA were 1.49 +/- 0.02 , 1.28 +/- 0.04 , 1.14 +/- 0.03 , and 0.93 +/- 0.08 ; the FI values of VEGF were 1.75 +/- 0.02 , 1.34 +/- 0.06 , 1.32 +/- 0.04 , and 1.23 +/- 0.04 ; the fluorescence index ( FI ) values of p21 were 1.26 +/- 0.05 , 1.36 +/- 0.06 , 1.61 +/- 0.03 , and 1.73 +/- 0.03 , respectively .

There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P &lt ; 0.05 or P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	['evading growth suppressors']
The scores of immunohistochemical staining of PCNA and VEGF proteins were decreased , while p21 increased .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
There were statistically significant differences between the control group and each treatment group ( P &lt ; 0.05 or P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	[]
CONCLUSION Genistein can inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells via apoptosis induction and cell cycle arrest at G(2)/M phase .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
The anti-tumor mechanisms of genistein may be related with the down-regulation of expression of VEGF and PCNA , and up-regulation of the expression of p21 .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
