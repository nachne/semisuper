SCOPE In this study , we evaluated the efficacy of lycopene against the growth of prostate cancer in vivo .	[]
METHODS AND RESULTS Athymic nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with human androgen-independent prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells .	[]
They were supplemented with a low or a high dose of lycopene ( 4 and 16âmg/kg ) and a single dose of Î²-carotene ( 16âmg/kg ) twice a week for 7 wk .	[]
At the end of the experiment , both lycopene and Î²-carotene strongly inhibited the tumor growth , as evidenced by the decrease in tumor volume and tumor weight .	[]
High-dosage lycopene and Î²-carotene significantly decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in tumor tissues and increased the levels of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 in plasma .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In addition , high-dosage lycopene supplementation significantly decreased the vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) levels in plasma .	['inducing angiogenesis']
In contrast , Î²-carotene supplementation significantly increased the VEGF levels , as compared with tumor control group .	['inducing angiogenesis']
CONCLUSION Lycopene and Î²-carotene supplementation suppressed the growth of prostate tumor cells , and the effects are likely associated with reduction of proliferation ( attenuation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression ) and with interference of the insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling ( increased plasma insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , the inhibition of VEGF by lycopene suggests that the antitumor mechanisms of lycopene also involve anti-angiogenesis .	['inducing angiogenesis']
