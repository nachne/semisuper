New molecularly targeted therapies are needed for childhood ependymoma .	[]
Angiogenesis and the PDGFR pathway could be potential therapeutic targets .	[]
This study aimed to screen ependymomas for the expression and clinicopathological correlates of angiogenic factors and potential therapeutic targets including VEGFR , endoglin ( CD105 ) , CD34 , CD31 , c-Kit , PDGFR-Î± and PDGFR-Î² .	[]
Immunohistochemistry for angiogenesis factors and PDGFR-Î± and Î² was performed in 24 archival tumor samples from children and adults treated for ependymoma at our institution .	[]
CD31 density , CD105 density and pericyte coverage index ( PCI ) were calculated .	[]
These findings were correlated with clinical outcome .	[]
VEGFR2 was overexpressed in tumor cells in only one out of 24 cases , but was found overexpressed in the vessels in 6 cases .	['inducing angiogenesis']
PDGFR-Î± and Î² were found to be over-expressed in the ependymoma tumor cells in seven out of 24 cases ( 29.2 % ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
CD31 density , CD105 density and PCI did not correlate with expression of PDGFRs .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Overexpression of PDGFR-Î± and Î² in tumor cells and overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in tumor endothelium had prognostic significance and this was maintained in multivariate analysis for overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in tumor cells ( 2 year progression free survival was 16.7 Â± 15.2 for cases with overexpression of PDGFR-Î± in the tumor vs. 74.5 Â± 15.2 for those with low/no expression , hazard ratio = 5.78 , p = 0.04 ) .

A number of angiogenic factors are expressed in ependymoma tumor cells and tumor endothelium .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Preliminary evidence suggests that the expression of PDGFRs could have a prognostic significance in ependymoma .	['inducing angiogenesis']
This data suggests that PDGFRs should be further evaluated as targets using novel PDGFR inhibitors .	['inducing angiogenesis']
