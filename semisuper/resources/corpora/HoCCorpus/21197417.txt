Pegylated Interferon-Î±2b ( pIFN-Î± ) is an integral part of the drug regimen currently employed against melanoma .	[]
Interferon Regulatory Factor-1 ( IRF-1 ) plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the IFN response , cell cycle and apoptosis .	[]
We have studied pIFN-Î± induced responses when combined with the chemotherapy agent , vinblastine in tumor and endothelial cell lines and the connection to IRF-1 signaling .	[]
Levels of IRF-1/IRF-2 protein expression were found to be decreased in tumor versus normal tissues. pIFN-Î± induced IRF-1 signaling in human melanoma ( M14 ) and endothelial ( EA.hy926 ) cells and enhanced cell death when combined with vinblastine .	[]
Upon combined IFN-Î± and vinblastine treatment , p21 expression , PARP cleavage and activated Bak levels were increased in M14 cells .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors']
An increase in p21 and cyclin D1 expression occurred in EA.hy926 cells after 6 h of treatment with pIFN-Î± which dissipated by 24 h .	[]
This biphasic response , characteristic of cellular senescence , was more pronounced upon combined treatment .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Exposure of the EA.hy926 cells to pIFN-Î± was associated with an enlarged , multinucleated , Î²-galactosidase-positive senescent phenotype .	['enabling replicative immortality']
The overall therapeutic mechanism of IFN-Î± combined with chemotherapy may be due to both direct tumor cell death via IRF-1 signaling and by premature senescence of endothelial cells and subsequent effects on angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment .
