Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) is a fatal pediatric disease .	[]
Thus far no therapeutic agent has proven beneficial in the treatment of this malignancy .	[]
Hence , conventional DNA-damaging radiotherapy ( RT ) remains the standard treatment , providing transient neurological improvement without improving probability of overall survival .	[]
During RT , WEE1 kinase controls the G2 cell cycle checkpoint allowing for repair of irradiation ( IR)-induced DNA damage .	[]
Here we show that WEE1 kinase is one of the highest overexpressed kinases in primary DIPG tissues as compared to matching non-neoplastic brain tissues .	[]
Inhibition of WEE1 by MK-1775 treatment of DIPG cells inhibited the IR-induced WEE1-mediated phosphorylation of CDC2 , resulting in reduced G2/M arrest and decreased cell viability .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Finally , we demonstrate that MK-1775 enhances the radiation response of E98-Fluc-mCherry DIPG mouse xenografts .	[]
Altogether , these results show that inhibition of WEE1 kinase in conjunction with RT holds potential as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of DIPG .	[]
