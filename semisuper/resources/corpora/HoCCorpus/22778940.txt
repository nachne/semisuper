Background .	[]
Over the past ten years oncological outcomes achieved by local excision techniques ( LETs ) as the sole treatment for early stages of rectal cancer ( ESRC ) have been often disappointing .	[]
The reasons for these poor results lie mostly in the high risk of the disease's diffusion to local-regional lymph nodes even in ESRC .	[]
Aims .	[]
This study aims to find the correct indications for LET in ESRC taking into consideration clinical-pathological features of tumours that may reduce the risk of lymph node metastasis to zero .	[]
Methods .	[]
Systematic literature review and meta-analysis of casistics of ESRC treated with total mesorectal excision with the aim of identifying risk factors for nodal involvement .	[]
Results .	[]
The risk of lymph node metastasis is higher in G â¥ 2 and T â¥ 2 tumours with lymphatic and/or vascular invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Other features which have not yet been sufficiently investigated include female gender , TSM stage &gt;1 , presence of tumour budding and/or perineural invasion .	[]
Conclusions .	[]
Results comparable to radical surgery can be achieved by LET only in patients with T(1) N(0) G(1) tumours with low-risk histological features , whereas deeper or more aggressive tumours should be addressed by radical surgery ( RS ) .	[]
