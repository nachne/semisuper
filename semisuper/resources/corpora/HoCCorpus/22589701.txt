Elevated aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells ( the Warburg effect ) may be attributed to respiration injury or mitochondrial dysfunction , but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic significance remain elusive .	[]
Here we report that induction of mitochondrial respiratory defect by tetracycline-controlled expression of a dominant negative form of DNA polymerase Î³ causes a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis and increases ROS generation .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'cellular energetics']
We show that upregulation of NOX is critical to support the elevated glycolysis by providing additional NAD+ .	['cellular energetics']
The upregulation of NOX is also consistently observed in cancer cells with compromised mitochondria due to the activation of oncogenic Ras or loss of p53 , and in primary pancreatic cancer tissues .	[]
Suppression of NOX by chemical inhibition or genetic knockdown of gene expression selectively impacts cancer cells with mitochondrial dysfunction , leading to a decrease in cellular glycolysis , a loss of cell viability , and inhibition of cancer growth in vivo .	['cellular energetics']
Our study reveals a previously unrecognized function of NOX in cancer metabolism and suggests that NOX is a potential novel target for cancer treatment .	[]
