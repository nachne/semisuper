We investigated the effects of valproic acid ( VPA ) , a histone deacetylase inhibitor , in combination with hydralazine , a DNA methylation inhibitor , on the expression of cell-surface Fas and MHC-class I-related chain molecules A and B ( MICA and B ) , the ligands of NKG2D which is an activating receptor of NK cells , and on production of their soluble forms in HOS , U-2 OS and SaOS-2 human osteosarcoma cell lines .	[]
We also examined the susceptibility of these cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death .	[]
VPA did not increase the expression of Fas on the surface of osteosarcoma cells , while hydralazine did , and the combination of VPA with hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface Fas .	['resisting cell death']
In contrast , the combination of VPA with hydralazine did not increase the production of soluble Fas by osteosarcoma cells .	['resisting cell death']
Both VPA and hydralazine increased the expression of cell-surface MICA and B in osteosarcoma cells , and their combination induced a greater increase in their expression .	[]
VPA inhibited the production of both soluble MICA and MICB by osteosarcoma cells while hydralazine produced no effect .	[]
Both VPA and hydralazine enhanced the susceptibility of osteosarcoma cells to Fas- and NK cell-mediated cell death and the combination of VPA with hydralazine further enhanced the effects .	['resisting cell death']
The present results suggest that combined administration of VPA and hydrazine is valuable for enhancing the therapeutic effects of immunotherapy for osteosarcomas .	[]
