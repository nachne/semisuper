Base analogs are powerful antimetabolites and dangerous mutagens generated endogenously by oxidative stress , inflammation , and aberrant nucleotide biosynthesis .	[]
Human inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase ( ITPA ) hydrolyzes triphosphates of noncanonical purine bases ( i.e. , ITP , dITP , XTP , dXTP , or their mimic : 6-hydroxyaminopurine ( HAP ) deoxynucleoside triphosphate ) and thus regulates nucleotide pools and protects cells from DNA damage .	[]
We demonstrate that the model purine base analog HAP induces DNA breaks in human cells and leads to elevation of levels of ITPA .	['genomic instability and mutation']
A human polymorphic allele of the ITPA , 94C-&gt;A encodes for the enzyme with a P32T amino-acid change and leads to accumulation of nonhydrolyzed ITP .	[]
The polymorphism has been associated with adverse reaction to purine base-analog drugs .	[]
The level of both spontaneous and HAP-induced DNA breaks is elevated in the cell line with the ITPA P32T variant .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The results suggested that human ITPA plays a pivotal role in the protection of DNA from noncanonical purine base analogs .	[]
