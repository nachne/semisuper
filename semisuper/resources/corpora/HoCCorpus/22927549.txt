Cancer immunoediting is the process whereby immune cells protect against cancer formation by sculpting the immunogenicity of developing tumors .	[]
Although the full process depends on innate and adaptive immunity , it remains unclear whether innate immunity alone is capable of immunoediting .	[]
To determine whether the innate immune system can edit tumor cells in the absence of adaptive immunity , we compared the incidence and immunogenicity of 3'methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas in syngeneic wild-type , RAG2(-/-) , and RAG2(-/-)x Î³c(-/-) mice .	[]
We found that innate immune cells could manifest cancer immunoediting activity in the absence of adaptive immunity .	['avoiding immune destruction']
This activity required natural killer ( NK ) cells and interferon Î³ ( IFN-Î³ ) , which mediated the induction of M1 macrophages .	[]
M1 macrophages could be elicited by administration of CD40 agonists , thereby restoring editing activity in RAG2(-/-)x Î³c(-/-) mice .	[]
Our results suggest that in the absence of adaptive immunity , NK cell production of IFN-Î³ induces M1 macrophages , which act as important effectors during cancer immunoediting .	['avoiding immune destruction']
