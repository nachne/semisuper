Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) such as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBP ) are wide-spread environmental pollutants most probably mutagenic and carcinogenic to humans .	[]
Detailed data on the cytogenetic effects of anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DBPDE ) in mammalian cells are not available in the literature .	[]
The aim of this study is to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the induction of chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges ( SCEs ) by DBPDE in mammalian cells .	[]
In order to achieve this a parental ( AA8 ) and different DNA repair-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell lines such as UV4 , UV5 , UV61 ( nucleotide excision repair , NER ) , EM9 ( base excision repair , BER ) , irs1SF ( homologous recombination repair , HRR ) and V3-3 ( non-homologous end joining , NHEJ ) were used .	[]
The most sensitive cell lines for DBPDE-induced chromosome aberrations were EM9 and irs1SF , while EM9 and V3-3 cell lines were the most sensitive in terms of SCEs induction .	[]
It can be suggested that the BER pathway plays an important role in the repair of lesions induced by DBPDE , affecting both chromosomal aberrations and SCEs induction .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Moreover , the HRR pathway seems to play a role in cellular resistance to DBPDE mainly in terms of chromosomal aberration induction while the NHEJ pathway takes part affecting only the induction of SCEs .	['genomic instability and mutation']
