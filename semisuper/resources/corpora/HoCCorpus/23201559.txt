Many molecular mechanisms contribute to the development of doxorubicin resistance and different cancers can express wide and diverse arrays of drug-resistance genes .	[]
The aim of this study was to identify the changes in gene expression associated with the development of doxorubicin resistance in MCF7 breast cancer cell line .	[]
The doxorubicin resistant MCF7 cell line was developed by stepwise selection of MCF7 cells and was tested using the MTT assay .	[]
The alterations in gene expression were examined using the real-time based PCR array .	[]
The findings showed an up-regulation of many phase I/II metabolizing genes , specifically , the CYP1A1 and the CYP1A2 that were up-regulated by 206- and 96-fold respectively .	[]
Drug efflux pump genes were also up-regulated profoundly .	[]
TOP2A was strongly down-regulated by 202-fold .	[]
Many other changes were observed in genes crucial for cell cycle , apoptosis and DNA repair .	['resisting cell death', 'genomic instability and mutation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
The findings of this project imply that the development of doxorubicin resistance is a multi-factorial process .	[]
