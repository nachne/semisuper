Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are generally used in tissue engineering , regenerative medicine and therapy for immune disorder disease .	[]
MSCs are also employed as drug carriers for tumor therapy due to their ability to migrate to tumor tissue .	[]
However , due to the immunosuppressive function of MSCs , the application of MSCs in prostate cancer therapy remains limited .	[]
In this study , we investigated the underlying mechanism by which MSCs enable prostate cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance in the inflammatory microenvironment .	[]
Firstly , we demonstrated that compared with the control groups , MSCs pretreated with IL-1Î± effectively promoted the growth of the mouse prostate cancer cell line RM-1 invivo .	[]
Furthermore , when RM-1 prostate cancer cells were co-injected with MSCs pretreated with IL-1Î± , tumor incidence significantly increased in allogeneic recipients .	[]
In addition , we investigated the mechanism through which MSCs promote the ability of RM-1 cells to escape from immune injury .	[]
The results revealed that IL-1Î± led to the upregulation of TGF-Î² in MSCs .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The inflammatory cytokine-induced promotive effect of MSCs on RM-1 cells in vivo was inhibited by TGF-Î² siRNA .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
The results of our study suggest that inflammatory cytokines induce the immunosuppressive function of MSCs which enables prostate cancer cells to escape from immune injury .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'avoiding immune destruction']
