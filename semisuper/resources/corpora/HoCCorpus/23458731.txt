We recently reported that chronic myeloid leukaemia ( CML ) patients harbour high levels of STAT5 when they progress to advanced phases of disease .	[]
Advanced disease is characterized by an increased incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations .	[]
We now describe a highly significant correlation between STAT5 expression and the incidence of BCR-ABL1 mutations in primary CML .	[]
Forced expression of STAT5 in murine BCR-ABL1 transformed cells sufficed to enhance the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and to trigger DNA damage .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'genomic instability and mutation']
STAT5-mediated ROS production is independent of JAK2 but requires concomitant BCR-ABL1 signalling as forced STAT5 expression in untransformed BCR-ABL1 negative cells has no impact on ROS levels .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Only within the context of a BCR-ABL1 positive cell does STAT5 transcriptionally regulate a target gene or set of genes that causes the enhanced ROS production .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Our study suggests the existence of a feed-forward loop accelerating disease progression , in which BCR-ABL1 enhances its own mutation rate in a STAT5-ROS dependent manner .	['genomic instability and mutation']
This model explains the increased occurrence of inhibitor-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations in advanced disease stages driven and characterized by high STAT5 expression .	['genomic instability and mutation']
