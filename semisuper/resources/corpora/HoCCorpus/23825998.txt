BACKGROUND Matrix metalloproteinases comprise a family of enzyme degrade components of extra cellular matrix .	[]
There are single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter regions of several genes with ability to influence cancer susceptibility .	[]
The aim of this study was to analyze association between MMP3 promoter polymorphisms and colorectal cancer occurrence and progression .	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS In this case-control study 120 colorectal cancer patients and 100 controls were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) on the genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) .	[]
The patients group was divided into different subgroups : a subgroup without metastatic activity ( M(-) ) and a subgroup that had developed metastasis ( M(+) ) .	[]
RESULTS There was a significant difference in frequency of the MMP-3 genotype between cases and controls ( χ΂ = 16.17 ; P = 0.0003 ) .	[]
The 5A homozygote in patients and controls was significantly different .	[]
The frequency of the 5A allele among affected patients ( 67.91% ) was significantly higher than among the healthy controls ( 49% ; χ(2) = 16.17 , P = 0.00005 ) .	[]
At the time of diagnosis , individual who was carrying the 5A allele was more represented in the M(+) subgroup than in M(-) subgroup ( χ² = 7.49 ; P = 0.006 , OR = 3.86 ; 95% CI , 1.43-10.33 ) .	[]
The difference between M(-) and controls did not observe statistically significant ( χ² = 0.009 ; P = 0.92 ) .	[]
CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that the presence of 5A polymorphism at the MMP-3 promoter region may favor the growth and the metastasis process in colorectal cancer patients and could be looked at as a risk factor for a worse prognosis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
