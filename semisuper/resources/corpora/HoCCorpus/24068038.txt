Accumulating data suggest arsenic may be an endocrine disruptor and tentatively linked to breast cancer by some studies .	[]
Therefore , we tested the effects of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure on the normal estrogen receptor ( ER)-negative breast epithelial cell line , MCF-10A .	[]
Cells were chronically exposed to a low-level arsenite ( 500nM ) for up to 24weeks .	[]
Markers of cancer cell phenotype and the expression of critical genes relevant to breast cancer or stem cells ( SCs ) were examined .	[]
After 24weeks , chronic arsenic-exposed breast epithelial ( CABE ) cells showed increases in secreted MMP activity , colony formation , invasion , and proliferation rate , indicating an acquired cancer cell phenotype .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
These CABE cells presented with basal-like breast cancer characteristics , including ER-Î± , HER-2 , and progesterone receptor negativity , and overexpression of K5 and p63 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Putative CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) breast SCs were increased to 80% over control in CABE cells .	[]
CABE cells also formed multilayer cell mounds , indicative of loss of contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
These mounds showed high levels of K5 and p63 , indicating the potential presence of cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) .	[]
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition occurred during arsenic exposure .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Overexpression of aromatase , a key rate-limiting enzyme in estrogen synthesis , occurred with arsenic starting early on in exposure .	[]
Levels of 17Î²-estradiol increased in CABE cells and their conditioned medium .	[]
The aromatase inhibitor letrozole abolished arsenic-induced increases in 17Î²-estradiol production and reversed cancer cell phenotype .	[]
Thus , chronic arsenic exposure drives human breast epithelia into a cancer cell phenotype with an apparent overabundance of putative CSCs .	[]
Arsenic appears to transform breast epithelia through overexpression of aromatase , thereby activating oncogenic processes independent of ER .	[]
