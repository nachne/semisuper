Tumor aerobic glycolysis , or the Warburg effect , plays important roles in tumor survival , growth , and metastasis .	[]
Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key enzyme that regulates aerobic glycolysis in tumor cells .	[]
Recent research has shown that PKM2 can be used as a tumor marker for diagnosis and , in particular , as a potential target for cancer therapy .	[]
We investigated the effects of combining shRNA targeting PKM2 and docetaxel on human A549 lung carcinoma cells both in vivo and in vitro .	[]
We observed that the shRNA can significantly downregulate the expression level of PKM2 .	[]
The decrease of PKM2 resulted in a decrease in ATP synthesis , which caused intracellular accumulation of docetaxel .	[]
Furthermore , the combination of pshRNA-pkm2 and docetaxel inhibited tumor growth and promoted more cancer cell apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro .	[]
Our findings suggest that targeting tumor glycolysis can increase the efficacy of chemotherapy .	['cellular energetics']
In particular , the targeting of PKM2 could , to some extent , be a new way of reversing chemotherapy resistance to cancer therapy .	[]
