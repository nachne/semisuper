BACKGROUND Epithelial mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is known to be associated with chemoresistance as well as increased invasion/metastasis .	[]
However , the relationship between EMT and resistance to an epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -targeting drug in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) remains unknown .	[]
In this study , we investigated the acquisition of EMT by gefitinib in HNSCC cell line ( UMSCC81B ) .	[]
METHODS We isolated fibroblastoid variant ( 81B-Fb ) from gefitinib-resistant UMSCC81B-GR3 cells obtained after increasing the doses of gefitinib treatment in vitro and examined EMT and its underlying mechanism .	[]
RESULT 81B-Fb cells exhibited fibroblast-like morphology , increased motility , loss of E-cadherin , acquisition of vimentin and snail expression .	[]
In 81B-Fb cells , downregulation of EGFR , which is mediated by increased ubiquitination , and activation of downstream protein kinase B ( Akt ) , glycogen synthase kinase-beta ( GSK-3Î² ) signalling and upregulation of snail expression were observed compared with UMSCC81B cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
LY294002 , but not U0126 , suppressed foetal bovine serum or heregulin-Î²1-induced phosphorylation of Akt/GSK-3Î² and snail expression together with the inhibition of 81B-Fb cell motility .	[]
Furthermore , forced expression of EGFR resulted in partial restoration of gefitinib sensitivity and reversal of EMT .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSION These results suggest that EMT in the gefitinib-resistant cells is mediated by the downregulation of EGFR and compensatory activation of Akt/GSK-3Î²/snail pathway .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
