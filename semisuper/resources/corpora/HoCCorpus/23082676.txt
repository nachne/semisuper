A metaphase chromosome analysis method was used to evaluate the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions in chronically intoxicated rats .	[]
The findings indicate that chronic inhalation exposure of the rats to volatile petroleum fractions at different concentrations results in a significant ( 2.5-fold ) increase , compared to the spontaneous level , in the occurrence of chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells in a number of generations .	['genomic instability and mutation']
In addition to chromosomal structural abnormalities , there are genomic changes ( aneuploidy , polyploidy ) .	['genomic instability and mutation']
There is a tendency towards an increased rate of petroleum-induced chromosomal aberrations in a number of generations ( P , F1 , and F2 ) in the rat bone marrow cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The maximum mutagenic effect of volatile petroleum fractions was found when used at concentrations of 10 and 100 mg/l upon long-term chronic exposure during three generations ( P1 , F1 , and F2 ) .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The findings are indicative of the mutagenic activity of volatile petroleum fractions , which is likely to pose a potential risk from environmental pollution to biota and population health in the area of intensive oil extraction and refining .	['genomic instability and mutation']
