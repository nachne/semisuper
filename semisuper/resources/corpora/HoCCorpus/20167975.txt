BACKGROUND &amp ; OBJECTIVE Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC or Lynch syndrome ) , is a genetically heterogeneous disorder that is believed to account for 2-10 per cent of all the colorectal cancer cases .	[]
The disease follows autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance ( 85% ) and younger age of onset when compared to patients with sporadic tumours .	[]
HNPCC is associated with germ-line mutations in the DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) genes namely MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 .	[]
The present study was aimed at analyzing mismatch repair gene(s) in an extended Indian family satisfying the Amsterdam criteria , and extending the analysis to general population to estimate frequency of the mutations/polymorphisms observed .	[]
METHODS A total 12 members of the HNPCC family were studied for genetic investigation .	[]
Ethnically matched 250 normal individuals were also included as controls to study the observed mutations/polymorphisms at population level .	[]
RESULTS The analysis resulted in identification of a 1975C&gt;T mutation in exon 17 , resulting in substitution of arginine residue with stop codon at codon 659. 655A&gt;G substitution was also observed , resulting in replacement of isoleucine with valine at codon 219 .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Similar analysis on 250 ethnically matched control subjects revealed complete absence of R659X mutation , while I219V variant was found in 9.8 per cent of the controls .	['genomic instability and mutation']
INTERPRETATION &amp ; CONCLUSION R659X mutation correlates with disease phenotype , and 655A&gt;G locus is highly polymorphic .	[]
Our study suggested that R659X substitution was prime cause for the disease phenotype in this family .	[]
I219V substitution is a polymorphism having no association with the disease onset or segregation .	[]
The family members harbouring this mutation were advised to be under regular medical surveillance .	[]
