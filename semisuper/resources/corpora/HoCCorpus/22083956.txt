Estrogen receptor ( ER ) and NF-ÎºB are transcription factors with profound effects on breast cancer cell proliferation and survival .	[]
While many studies demonstrate that ER and NF-ÎºB can repress each other , we previously identified a gene signature that is synergistically upregulated by these two factors in more aggressive luminal B breast tumors .	[]
Herein , we examine a novel mechanism of cross talk between ER and NF-ÎºB that results in the upregulation of the antiapoptotic gene BIRC3 ( also known as cIAP2 ) .	[]
We demonstrate that NF-ÎºB , acting through two response elements , is required for ER recruitment to an adjacent estrogen response element ( ERE ) in the BIRC3 promoter .	[]
This effect is accompanied by a major increase in NF-ÎºB-dependent histone acetylation around the ERE .	[]
Interestingly , CBP , a histone acetyltransferase previously implicated in repressive interactions between ER and NF-ÎºB , plays a permissive role by promoting histone acetylation and ER recruitment , as well as enhanced expression of BIRC3 .	[]
These findings suggest a new gene regulatory mechanism by which inflammation and NF-ÎºB activation can influence ER recruitment to inherently inactive ER binding sites .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
This fine-tuning mechanism may explain how two factors that generally repress each other's activity may work together on certain genes to promote breast cancer cell survival and tumor progression .	[]
