Within the family of protein kinase C ( PKC ) molecules , the novel isoform PRKCE ( PKCÉ ) acts as a bona fide oncogene in in vitro and in vivo models of tumorigenesis .	[]
Previous studies have reported expression of PKCÉ in breast , prostate and lung tumors above that of normal adjacent tissue .	[]
Data from the cancer genome atlas suggest increased copy number of PRKCE in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) .	[]
We find that overexpression of PKCÉ in a non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition and results in the formation of cellular foci .	['evading growth suppressors']
Correspondingly , inhibition of PKCÉ in a TNBC cell model results in growth defects in two-dimensional ( 2D ) and three-dimensional ( 3D ) culture conditions and orthotopic xenografts .	[]
Using stable isotope labeling of amino acids in a cell culture phosphoproteomic approach , we find that CTNND1/p120ctn phosphorylation at serine 268 ( P-S268 ) occurs in a strictly PKCÉ-dependent manner , and that loss of PKCÉ signaling in TNBC cells leads to reversal of mesenchymal morphology and signaling .	[]
In a model of Ras activation , inhibition of PKCÉ is sufficient to block mesenchymal cell morphology .	[]
Finally , treatment with a PKCÉ ATP mimetic inhibitor , PF-5263555 , recapitulates genetic loss of function experiments impairing p120ctn phosphorylation as well as compromising TNBC cell growth in vitro and in vivo .	[]
We demonstrate PKCÉ as a tractable therapeutic target for TNBC , where p120ctn phosphorylation may serve as a readout for monitoring patient response.Oncogene advance online publication , 1 April 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.91 .	[]
