Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is an endemic malignant disease of the head and neck region with unique features including striking ethnic and geographic variations as well as multifactorial etiology .	[]
Previous studies have demonstrated the anticancer properties of genistein , the major soy isoflavonoid , in several human cancer cells such as breast , prostate , colon , gastric , lung , and hepatoma .	[]
However , the action of genistein in NPC cells has not been determined .	[]
In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of genistein on NPC cells and its possible underlying mechanisms .	[]
We found that genistein dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human NPC cell line CNE2 cells .	[]
DNA flow cytometric analysis revealed that 30 to 120 microM genistein induced dramatic G2/M phase arrest in NPC cells .	['evading growth suppressors']
The mRNA expression levels , as shown by gene expression array and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and the protein expression levels of the cell cycle regulators p21(Cip1) and ATR ( Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related ) were elevated following genistein treatment .	['evading growth suppressors']
Interestingly , we also observed concomitant induction of p15(Ink4b) in genistein induced inhibitory effects in NPC cells .	[]
Moreover , selective estrogen receptor modulators did not affect genistein induced growth inhibition .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These findings provide new insights into the potential intervention of NPC with genistein .	[]
