OBJECTIVE Chronic generation of inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species are implicated in atherosclerosis , aging , cancers , and other chronic diseases .	[]
We hypothesized that zinc induces A20 in premonocytic , endothelial , and cancer cells , and A20 binds to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF)-receptor associated factor , and inhibits IÎº kinase-Î± ( IKK-Î±)/nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) , resulting in downregulation of TNF-Î± and interleukin-1Î² ( IL-1Î² ) .	[]
METHODS To test this hypothesis , we used HL-60 , human umbilical vein endothelial cells , and SW480 cell lines under zinc-deficient and zinc-sufficient conditions in this study .	[]
We measured oxidative stress markers , inflammatory cytokines , A20 protein and mRNA , A20-FRAF-1 complex , and IKK-Î±/NF-ÎºB signaling in stimulated zinc-deficient and zinc sufficient cells .	[]
We also conducted antisense A20 and siRNA studies to investigate the regulatory role of zinc in TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² via A20 .	[]
RESULTS We found that zinc increased A20 and A20-tumor necrosis factor-receptor associated factor-1 complex , decreased the IKK-Î±/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway , oxidative stress markers , and inflammatory cytokines in these cells compared with zinc-deficient cells .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
We confirmed that zinc-induced A20 contributes to downregulation of TNF-Î± and IL-1Î² by antisense and short interfering RNA A20 studies .	[]
CONCLUSION Our studies suggest that zinc suppresses generation of NF-ÎºB-regulated inflammatory cytokines by induction of A20 .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
