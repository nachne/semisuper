BACKGROUND The immune system plays an important role in the multifactorial biologic system during the development of neoplasias .	[]
However , the involvement of the inflammatory response in the promotion/control of malignant cells is still controversial , and the cell subsets and the mechanisms involved are poorly investigated .	[]
The goal of this study was to characterize the clinical-pathological status and the immunophenotyping profile of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with the animal survival rates in canine mammary carcinomas .	[]
METHODS Fifty-one animals with mammary carcinomas , classified as carcinomas in mixed tumors-MC-BMT = 31 and carcinomas-MC = 20 were submitted to systematic clinical-pathological analysis ( tumor size ; presence of lymph node and pulmonary metastasis ; clinical stage ; histological grade ; inflammatory distribution and intensity as well as the lymphocytic infiltrate intensity ) and survival rates .	[]
Twenty-four animals ( MC-BMT = 16 and MC = 8 ) were elected to the immunophenotypic study performed by flow cytometry .	[]
RESULTS Data analysis demonstrated that clinical stage II-IV and histological grade was I more frequent in MC-BMT as compared to MC .	[]
Univariate analysis demonstrated that the intensity of inflammation ( moderate/intense ) and the proportion of CD4+ ( &gt ; or = 66.7% ) or CD8+ T-cells ( &lt;33.3% ) were not associated with worse survival rate .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only lymphocytic infiltrate intensity &gt ; or = 600 ( P = 0.02 ) remained as independent prognostic factor .	[]
Despite the clinical manifestation , the lymphocytes represented the predominant cell type in the tumor infiltrate .	[]
The percentage of T-cells was higher in animals with MC-BMT without metastasis , while the percentage of B-lymphocytes was greater in animals with metastasized MC-BMT ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'avoiding immune destruction']
The relative percentage of CD4+ T-cells was significantly greater in metastasized tumors ( both MC-BMT and MC ) , ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) while the proportion of CD8+ T-cells was higher in MC-BMT without metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'avoiding immune destruction']
Consequently , the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly increased in both groups with metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'avoiding immune destruction']
Regardless of the tumor type , the animals with high proportions of CD4+ and low CD8+ T-cells had decreased survival rates .	['avoiding immune destruction']
CONCLUSION The intensity of lymphocytic infiltrate and probably the relative abundance of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes may represent important survival prognostic biomarkers for canine mammary carcinomas .	['avoiding immune destruction']
