OBJECTIVE To study the effect of necrostatin ( Nec-1 ) on apoptosis induced by aluminum ( Al ) , and approach the mechanism .	[]
METHODS Neural cell death model was made by 4 mmol/L Al treated neuroblastoma cells ( SH-SY5Y ) .	[]
Cell viabilities were detected at different concentrations of Al and/or Nec-1 .	[]
Hoechst 33342/PI double staining was used to observe apoptosis and ( or ) necrosis that were quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI double staining .	[]
Apoptotic pathway was tested by activities of Caspase-3 , Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 .	[]
In addition , the expression of NF-kappa B and Cyt-c was measured by immunocytochemistry .	[]
RESULTS Cell viabilities were significantly decreased with the increasing concentrations of Al ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , which could be significantly upregulated by 60 micromol/L Nec-1 ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) and were correlated with the concentrations of Nec-1 ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	[]
Apoptosis and necrosis were observed under fluorescent microscope and quantified by flow cytometry , which suggested an increasing trend of apoptotic and necrotic rates ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	['resisting cell death']
Whereas , Nec-1 could not only decrease the necrotic rate but also apoptotic rate as well ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) .	['resisting cell death']
Data of Nec-1 on caspases activities showed that Nec-1 could not affect Caspase-9 activity ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) and Cty-c protein expression as well ( P &gt ; 0.05 ) .	[]
However , Nec-1 could reduce Caspase-8 activity significantly ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) and increase NF-kappa B protein expression ( P &lt ; 0.05 , P &lt ; 0.01 ) and finally decrease Caspase-3 activity ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	[]
CONCLUSION Nec-1 could reduce cell apoptosis induced by Al , through Caspase-8 pathway , and up-regulate the expression of NF-kappa B protein .	[]
