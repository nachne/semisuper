Altered p53 protein is prevalently associated with the pathologic class of triple-negative breast cancers and loss of p53 function has recently been linked to the induction of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and acquisition of stemness properties .	[]
We explored the association between TP53 mutational status and expression of some genes involved in the canonical TGF-β signaling pathway ( the most potent EMT inducer ) and in two early EMT associated events : loss of cell polarity and acquisition of stemness-associated features .	[]
We used a publicly accessible microarray dataset consisting of 251 p53-sequenced primary breast cancers .	[]
Statistical analysis indicated that mutant p53 tumors ( especially those harboring a severe mutation ) were consistent with the aggressive class of triple-negative cancers and that , differently from cell cultures , surgical tumors underexpressed some TGF-β related transcription factors known as involved in EMT ( ID1 , ID4 , SMAD3 , SMAD4 , SMAD5 , ZEB1 ) .	['genomic instability and mutation', 'activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
These unexpected findings suggest an interesting relationship between p53 mutation , mammary cell dedifferentiation , and the concomitant acquisition of stemlike properties ( as indicated by the overexpression of PROM1 and NOTCH1 genes ) , which improve tumor cells aggressiveness as indicated by the overexpression of genes associated with cell proliferation ( CDK4 , CDK6 , MKI67 ) and migration ( CXCR4 , MMP1 ) .	['genomic instability and mutation', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
