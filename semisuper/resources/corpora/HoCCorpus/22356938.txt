Mast cells ( MC ) are key effector cells in allergic reactions but also involved in host defence , tissue remodeling , angiogenesis , and fibrogenesis .	[]
Here , we show that human intestinal fibroblasts ( FB ) suppress apoptosis in human intestinal MC dependent on IL-6 .	['resisting cell death']
Intestinal FB produced IL-6 upon direct stimulation by intestinal MC in co-culture or by MC mediators such as TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² , tryptase or histamine .	[]
MC incubated with IL-6 survived for up to 3 weeks similar to MC co-cultured with FB and MC survival could be blocked by neutralizing anti-IL-6 Abs .	[]
Moreover , FB stimulated by MC mediators upregulated their expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ( MMP-1 ) , a key fibrolytic enzyme .	[]
Noteworthy , FB co-cultured with MC or treated with MMP-1 lost confluence and showed increased numbers of apoptotic cells .	['resisting cell death']
Our data indicate an intimate cross talk between mucosal MC and FB resulting in MC survival and induction of a fibrolytic rather than a profibrotic state in FB .	[]
