Human breast tumors are infiltrated by memory CD4(+) T cells along with increased numbers of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) that facilitate immune escape and correlate with poor prognosis .	[]
Here , we report that inducible costimulatory molecule ( ICOS ) , a T cell costimulatory molecule of the CTLA4/PD1/CD28 family , is expressed mostly by tumor-associated Treg in primary breast tumors .	[]
A large proportion of these ICOS(+) Treg were Ki67(+) and this evident proliferative expansion was found to rely on interactions with tumor-associated pDC .	[]
Indeed , tumor-associated Treg highly expanded in presence of pDC but failed to proliferate under CD3/CD28 signal .	[]
In vitro experiments revealed that the addition of a neutralizing anti-ICOS antibody blocked pDC-induced Treg expansion and interleukin-10 secretion by memory CD4(+) T cells , establishing a pivotal role for ICOS in this process .	['avoiding immune destruction']
Supporting these findings , the presence of ICOS(+) cells in clinical specimens of breast cancer correlated with a poor prognosis .	[]
Together , our results highlight an important relationship between Treg and pDC in breast tumors , and show that ICOS/ICOS-L interaction is a central event in immunosuppression of tumor-associated memory CD4(+) T cells .	['avoiding immune destruction']
These findings strongly rationalize antibody-mediated ICOS blockade as a powerful clinical strategy to correct immune escape and promote therapeutic responses in breast cancer .	[]
