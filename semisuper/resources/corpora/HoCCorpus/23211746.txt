Lesion-specific enzymes repair different forms of DNA damage , yet all lesions elicit the same checkpoint response .	[]
The common intermediate required to mount a checkpoint response is thought to be single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , coated by replication protein A ( RPA ) and containing a primer-template junction .	[]
To identify factors important for initiating the checkpoint response , we screened for genes that , when overexpressed , could amplify a checkpoint signal to a weak allele of chk1 in fission yeast .	[]
We identified Ast1 , a novel member of the XPG-related family of endo/exonucleases .	[]
Ast1 promotes checkpoint activation caused by the absence of the other XPG-related nucleases , Exo1 and Rad2 , the homologue of Fen1 .	[]
Each nuclease is recruited to DSBs , and promotes the formation of ssDNA for checkpoint activation and recombinational repair .	['genomic instability and mutation']
For Rad2 and Exo1 , this is independent of their S-phase role in Okazaki fragment processing .	[]
This XPG-related pathway is distinct from MRN-dependent responses , and each enzyme is critical for damage resistance in MRN mutants .	[]
Thus , multiple nucleases collaborate to initiate DNA damage responses , highlighting the importance of these responses to cellular fitness .	['genomic instability and mutation']
