Gliomas display anoikis resistance , enhanced invasion in to the adjacent brain parenchyma and eventually recur despite using the standard therapies .	[]
Our studies on increased anoikis sensitization in matrix metalloproteinase-2 ( MMP-2)-knockdown 4910 and 5310 human glioma xenograft cells were interestingly correlated with p21-activated kinase 4 ( PAK4 ) inhibition , prompting us to further investigate the role of PAK4 in glioma .	[]
Here , we report the PAK4 upregulation in positive correlation with increasing glioma pathological grades .	[]
The siRNA-mediated PAK4 knockdown elevated anoikis , and inhibited invasion and migration by downregulating MMP-2 , Î±vÎ²3-integrin and phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor ( phospho-EGFR ) .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
The cDNA-PCR arrays revealed a transcriptional suppression of essential proteins involved in cell proliferation and adhesion in PAK4-knockdown cells .	[]
Most importantly , glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated the MMP-2 as a new PAK4-interacting protein which binds to PAK4 kinase domain .	[]
Individual EGFR/ErbB2 inhibitor and Î±vÎ²3 antibody treatments in PAK4si-treated cells indicated the regulation of Î±vÎ²3/EGFR survival signaling by PAK4 .	[]
Overexpression of PAK4 significantly reversed the MMP2si-induced cell death in both cell lines .	['resisting cell death']
Codepletion of PAK4 and MMP-2 resulted in robust anoikis-mediated cell death , and severely inhibited invasive and migratory properties in these cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
PAK4si inhibited in vivo tumor growth in nude mice by inhibiting MMP-2 , Î²3-integrin and phospho-EGFR levels in tumors .	[]
Our findings indicate a physical association between PAK4 and MMP-2 , and suggest the future therapeutic potential of PAK4/MMP-2 dual targeting in glioma treatment .	[]
