Zinc dyshomeostasis can induce cell death .	[]
However , the mechanisms involved have not been fully elucidated in prostate cancer ( PCa ) cells , which differ dramatically from normal cells in their zinc handling ability .	[]
Here , we studied the effects of the ionophore Zn-pyrithione ( ZP ) and the chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine ( TPEN ) .	[]
Both compounds induced cell death at micromolar concentrations when incubated with androgen-dependent ( LNCaP ) , androgen-independent ( PC3 , DU145 ) and androgen-sensitive ( C4-2 ) PCa cell-lines .	[]
Compared to PCa cells , RWPE1 prostate epithelial cells were less sensitive to ZP and more sensitive to TPEN , but total cellular zinc levels were changed similarly .	[]
ZnSO4 enhanced the toxicity of ZP , but inhibited the effects of TPEN as expected .	[]
The morphological/biochemical responses to ZP and TPEN differed .	[]
ZP decreased ATP levels and stimulated ERK , AKT and PKC phosphorylation .	[]
DNA laddering was observed only at low doses of ZP but all doses of TPEN .	[]
TPEN activated caspase 3/7 and induced PARP-cleavage , DNA-fragmentation , ROS-formation and apoptotic bodies .	['resisting cell death']
PKC and ERK-pathway inhibitors , and antioxidants protected against ZP-induced but not TPEN-induced death .	[]
Inhibitors of MPTP-opening protected both .	[]
Cell death in response to TPEN ( but not ZP ) was diminished by a calpain inhibitor and largely prevented by a caspase 3 inhibitor .	[]
Overall , the results indicated primarily a necrotic cell death for ZP and an apoptotic cell death for TPEN .	[]
The enhanced sensitivity of PCa cells to ZP and the apparent ability of ZP and TPEN to kill quiescent and rapidly dividing cells in a p53-independent manner suggest that ZP/TPEN might be used to develop adjunct treatments for PCa .	[]
