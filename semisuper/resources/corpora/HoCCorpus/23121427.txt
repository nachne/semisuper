The most potent tumorigen identified among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAH ) is the nonplanar fjord region dibenzo[a,l]pyrene ( DB[a,l]P ) .	[]
It is metabolically activated in vivo through the widely studied diol epoxide ( DE ) pathway to form covalent adducts with DNA bases , predominantly guanine and adenine .	[]
The ( +)-11S,12R,13R,14S DE enantiomer forms adducts via its C14 position with the exocyclic amino group of guanine .	[]
Here , we present the first nuclear magnetic resonance solution structure of a DB[a,l]P-derived adduct , the 14R-(+)-trans-anti-DB[a,l]P-N(2)-dG ( DB[a,l]P-dG ) lesion in double-stranded DNA .	['genomic instability and mutation']
In contrast to the stereochemically identical benzo[a]pyrene-derived N(2)-dG adduct ( B[a]P-dG ) in which the B[a]P rings reside in the B-DNA minor groove on the 3'-side of the modifed deoxyguanosine , in the DB[a,l]P-derived adduct the DB[a,l]P rings intercalate into the duplex on the 3'-side of the modified base from the sterically crowded minor groove .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Watson-Crick base pairing of the modified guanine with the partner cytosine is broken , but these bases retain some stacking with the bulky DB[a,l]P ring system .	[]
This new theme in PAH DE-DNA adduct conformation differs from ( 1 ) the classical intercalation motif in which Watson-Crick base pairing is intact at the lesion site and ( 2 ) the base-displaced intercalation motif in which the damaged base and its partner are extruded from the helix .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The structural considerations that lead to the intercalated conformation of the DB[a,l]P-dG lesion in contrast to the minor groove alignment of the B[a]P-dG adduct , and the implications of the DB[a,l]P-dG conformational motif for the recognition of such DNA lesions by the human nucleotide excision repair apparatus , are discussed .
