To evaluate a radioprotective effect of sodium n-propyl thiosulfate ( NPTS ) and sodium 2-propenyl thiosulfate ( 2PTS ) derived from onions and garlic , respectively , rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were preincubated with each of these compounds for 48 hours at 37Â°C before receiving 10 Gy of X-ray irradiation .	[]
Cell damage caused by the irradiation was quantified as comet tail moment , which represents the degree of DNA damage .	[]
X-ray-induced DNA damage was significantly decreased in both H4IIE and L5178Y cells by micromolar concentrations of NPTS and 2PTS compared with the control without the compounds .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The protective effect was more potent with 2PTS than NPTS .	[]
Onions and garlic have antiradiation potential .	[]
