The aim of the present work was to study the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , mediated by bFGF signaling and its possible crosstalk with prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cell lines .	[]
PC3 cells stably transfected with PSMA gene were used for restoring PSMA expression .	[]
LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells were exposed to 10ng/mL of basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) .	[]
IL-6 production was measured by ELISA assay , and levels of PSMA expression were assessed by flow cytometry .	[]
AKT , ERK1/2 , and p38 phosphorylation were detected by Western blot. bFGF enhances IL-6 production in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA prostate cancer cells .	[]
The effect of bFGF on stimulating IL-6 secretion was greater in LNCaP than in PC3-PSMA cells .	[]
In the presence of bFGF , PSMA expression was activated after 4days of treatment in LNCaP and PC3-PSMA cells .	[]
This activation was not maintained after long term of treatment in both metastatic cell lines .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Solely MAPKs pathways ( ERK1/2 and p38 ) were activated after bFGF stimulation in both metastatic cell lines , whereas AKT did not show any activation .	[]
The interference of the proinflammatory cytokine , IL-6 , with bFGF signaling and PSMA , should be of high clinical relevance in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
In developing novel therapeutic modalities targeting IL-6 , significant attention should be given to PSMA and its inactivation to fight against prostate cancer .	[]
