Immunosuppressive oligodeoxynucleotides ( SupODNs ) containing repetitive TTAGGG motifs reduce inflammation and , thus , may have an impact on inflammationârelated tumor growth .	[]
In this study , we found a significant antiproliferative effect of Sup ODNs on the A549 nonâsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cell line compared to those treated with control ODNs ( p&lt;0.05 ) .	[]
Sup-ODN-mediated G1 phase cell cycle arrest was achieved via inhibition of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and the p15INK4b and p27KIP1/retinoblastoma protein pathway .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
In addition , Sup ODNs induced apoptosis and enhanced apoptosis when combined with vinorelbine .	['resisting cell death']
In a setting similar to clinical use of multidrug chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC , these effects were investigated by using Sup ODNs in combination with conventional anticancer drugs .	[]
Sup ODNs had a significant synergistic effect with 5-fluorouracil , vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel and irinotecan , with a mean combination index of 0.43-0.78 ( &lt;1.0 indicates synergism ) in the A549 NSCLC cell line .	[]
In conclusion , our results showed that Sup ODNs have an anticancer effect and increase the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to conventional anticancer drugs by modifying Akt and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 pathway .	[]
Thus , Sup ODNs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for NSCLC patients .	[]
