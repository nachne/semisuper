Levels of regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) are increased in different cancer types as well as in inflammatory diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis .	[]
Treg accumulation may result from aberrant proliferation and trafficking as well as greater resilience to oxidative stress compared with conventional T cells .	[]
This enhanced antioxidative capacity of Tregs possibly serves as feedback inhibition during inflammation and prevents uncontrolled immune reactions by favoring survival of suppressor rather than effector cells .	[]
In this study , we demonstrate that human Tregs express and secrete higher levels of thioredoxin-1 , a major antioxidative molecule .	[]
Thioredoxin-1 has an essential role in maintaining their surface thiol density as the first line of antioxidative defense mechanisms and is sensitive to proinflammatory stimuli , mainly tumor necrosis factor-Î± , in a nuclear factor-ÎºB-dependent fashion .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
The antiapoptotic and oncogenic potential of ( secreted ) Trx-1 suggests that it may exert effects in Tregs beyond redox regulation .	[]
