The DNA repair protein Ku70 is a key player in chemoresistance to anticancer agents ( e.g. , etoposide ) or radioresistance .	[]
The responses of different organs to radiation vary widely and likely depend on the cell population in the organs .	[]
Previously , we established and characterized Ku70-deficient murine lung epithelial ( Ku70 -/- MLE ) cells and found that these cells are more sensitive than Ku70 +/- MLE cells ( control cells ) to X-irradiation , as determined by clonogenic survival assay ; however , the mechanism underlying this sensitivity remains unclear .	[]
In this study , we examined the mechanism by which X-irradiation triggers the death of Ku70 -/- MLE cells .	[]
Our results showed that Ku70 -/- MLE cells were more sensitive to radiation-induced apoptosis than control cells , although X-irradiation activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 , and cleaved PARP in both cell lines .	['resisting cell death']
We also examined the expression level of phosphorylated H2AX ( γH2AX ) , which is a marker of DSB , and observed the phosphorylation of H2AX and the elimination of γH2AX in both cell lines after X-irradiation .	[]
The elimination in Ku70 -/- MLE cells was slower than that in control cells , suggesting that DSB repair activity in the Ku70 -/- MLE cells is lower than that in control cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
These findings suggest that Ku70 might play a key role in the inhibition of apoptosis through the DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells .	['resisting cell death', 'genomic instability and mutation']
Our findings also suggest that these cell lines might be useful for the study of Ku70 functions and the Ku70-dependent DSB repair pathway in lung epithelial cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
