Lewis y ( LeY ) antigen is a difucosylated oligosaccharide carried by glycoconjugates on the cell surface .	[]
Overexpression of LeY is frequently observed in epithelial-derived cancers and has been correlated to the pathological staging and prognosis .	[]
However , the effects of LeY on ovarian cancer are not yet clear .	[]
Previously , we transfected the ovarian cancer cell line RMG-I with the Î±1,2-fucosyltransferase gene to obtain stable transfectants , RMG-I-H , that highly express LeY .	[]
In the present study , we examined the proliferation , tumorigenesis , adhesion and invasion of the cell lines with treatment of LeY monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) .	[]
Additionally , we examined the expression of TGF-Î²1 , VEGF and b-FGF in xenograft tumors .	[]
The results showed that the proliferation and adhesion in vitro were significantly inhibited by treatment of RMG-I-H cells with LeY mAb .	[]
When subcutaneously inoculated in nude mice , RMG-I-H cells produced large tumors , while mock-transfected cells RMG-I-C and the parental cells RMG-I produced small tumors .	[]
Moreover , the tumor formation by RMG-I-H cells was inhibited by preincubating the cells with LeY mAb .	[]
Notably , the expression of TGF-Î²1 , VEGF and b-FGF all increased in RMG-I-H cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In conclusion , LeY plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation , tumorigenecity and adhesion , and these effects may be related to increased levels of growth factors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The LeY antibody shows potential application in the treatment of LeY-positive tumors .	[]
