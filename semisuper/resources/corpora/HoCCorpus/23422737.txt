HM781-36B is an orally administered pan-human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) inhibitor .	[]
To explore the role of pan-HER inhibitor in breast cancer , we investigated the antitumor effect and mechanisms of HM781-36B in breast cancer cell lines .	[]
Six breast cancer cell lines ( BT474 , MDA-MB-453 , SK-BR-3 , T47D , MCF-7 , and MDA-MB-231 ) were tested .	[]
The growth inhibitory effect was assessed using the tetrazolium bromide [ 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide ] assay .	[]
The cell cycle at various concentrations of HM781-36B was analyzed by flow cytometry , and analysis of downstream molecules was performed by western blot analysis .	[]
Interaction of HM781-36B with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents was analyzed by combination index using CalcuSyn .	[]
The HER2-amplified cells ( SK-BR-3 , BT474 , and MDA-MB-453 ) were sensitive to HM781-36B ( IC50=0.001 Î¼mol/l , 0.0012 Î¼mol/l , and 0.0095 Î¼mol/l , respectively ) .	[]
HM781-36B induced G1 arrest and resulted in apoptosis .	['resisting cell death', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
It reduced the level of p-HER2 , p-AKT , p-ERK , and p-STAT3 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
HM781-36B combined with 5-fluorouracil , cisplatin , paclitaxel , or gemcitabine showed a synergistic inhibitory effect on the HER2-amplified and on some of the HER2-nonamplified breast cancer cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
HM781-36B could be a promising treatment for HER2-amplified breast cancer as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents and can be a candidate for treatment of HER2-nonamplified breast cancer in combination with cytotoxic agents .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
