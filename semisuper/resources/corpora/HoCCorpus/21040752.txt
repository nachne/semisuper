Several studies have indicated that the cell-surface expressed nucleolin is implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis , and represents an important target for cancer therapy .	[]
Here we show that treatment of rhabdoid tumor derived G401 cells with a nucleolin antagonist , the HB-19 pseudopeptide , could restore contact inhibition , impair anchorage-independent growth , and suppress tumor development in nude mice .	['evading growth suppressors']
G401 cells grow without contact inhibition , which is an in vitro characteristic property of malignant tumor cells .	[]
At concentrations of HB-19 that does not affect cell viability and multiplication index , there is restoration of contact inhibition thus suggesting that HB-19 treatment causes reversion of the malignant phenotype .	['evading growth suppressors']
Accordingly , HB-19 pretreated G401 cells lose the capacity to form colonies in soft agar .	[]
When assayed for tumorigenicity in nude mice , only 50% of mice injected with HB-19 pretreated G401 cells developed tumors with the mean tumor weight of 0.32 g , compared to 100% of mice injected with control G401 cells with the mean tumor weight of 2.36 g .	[]
Interestingly , the restoration of contact inhibition in HB-19 treated G401 cells is concomitant with marked reduction of transcripts coding the Wilms ' tumor 1 gene , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , epithelial isoform of CD44 , and vascular endothelial growth factor , whereas no apparent modification is detected for transcripts coding the proto-oncogene c-Myc , anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 , pro-apoptotic Bax , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP-1 , angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1 , and growth factor Midkine .	[]
These findings indicate that the molecular mechanism of action of HB-19 on such highly malignant rhabdoid tumor cells is associated with a selective inhibitory effect on the expression of genes implicated in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis .	[]
