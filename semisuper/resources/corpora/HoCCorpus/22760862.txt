Geraniol ( GOH ) , a naturally occurring monoterpene , has been shown to have antiproliferative , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis-inducing effects , and represents a promising cancer chemopreventive agent .	[]
In the present study , we investigated the chemopreventive potential of GOH ( 50 and 100âmgâkg(-1) body weight ) against 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene ( DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA)-mediated skin tumorigenesis in Swiss albino mice .	[]
The topical treatment of GOH , 30âmin prior to TPA ( 2âÂµg per 200âÂµl of acetone ) treatment significantly inhibited TPA-induced skin edema , hyperplasia , COX-2 induction and oxidative stress response .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
The GOH treatment also resulted in reduction of TPA-induced ornithine decarboxylase activity and [ (3) H ] thymidine incorporation by 53% ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and 41% ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) , respectively .	[]
We found that GOH treatment significantly inhibited the tumor incidence and number of tumors ( Pâ&lt;â0.001 ) and extended the latency period from 4âweeks in DMBA/TPA treatment group to 10âweeks in GOH-pretreated mice .	[]
Furthermore , we observed that GOH treatment significantly suppressed the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signaling pathway in skin tumor .	[]
Consistently , GOH-treated skin tumors showed reduced expression of Bcl-2 and increased expression of Bax in these lesions .	['resisting cell death']
Thus , it was concluded that GOH inhibits DMBA/TPA-mediated skin tumorigenesis by attenuating the Ras proliferation pathway and inducing pro-apoptotic state via inhibition of oxidative stress response and inflammation .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']
