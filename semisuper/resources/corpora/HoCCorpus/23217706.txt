Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a key eventduring tumorigenesis .	[]
Despite being known for decades ( Warburg effect ) , the molecular mechanisms regulating this switch remained unexplored .	[]
Here , we identify SIRT6 as a tumor suppressor thatregulates aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells .	[]
Importantly , loss of SIRT6 leads to tumor formation without activation of known oncogenes , whereas transformed SIRT6-deficient cells display increased glycolysis and tumor growth , suggesting that SIRT6 plays a role in both establishment and maintenance of cancer .	['cellular energetics']
By using a conditional SIRT6 allele , we show that SIRT6 deletion invivo increases the number , size , and aggressiveness of tumors .	['genomic instability and mutation']
SIRT6 also functions as a regulator of ribosome metabolismby corepressing MYC transcriptional activity .	[]
Lastly,Sirt6 is selectively downregulated in several human cancers , and expression levels of SIRT6 predict prognosis and tumor-free survival rates , highlighting SIRT6 as a critical modulator of cancermetabolism .	[]
Our studies reveal SIRT6 to be a potent tumor suppressor acting to suppress cancer metabolism .	[]
