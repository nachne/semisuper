Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) , a subgroup of ligand-activated nuclear receptors , plays critical roles in cell cycle regulation , differentiation , apoptosis and invasion .	[]
PPARÎ³ is involved in tumorigenesis and is a potent target for cancer therapy .	[]
PPARÎ³ transactivation of KLF4 has been demonstrated in various studies ; however , how PPARÎ³ regulates KLF4 expression is not clear .	[]
In this study , we revealed that PPARÎ³ regulates the expression of KLF4 by binding directly to the PPAR response element ( PPRE ) within the KLF4 promoter .	[]
The PPRE resided at -1657bp to -1669bp upstream of the KLF4 ATG codon , which is essential for the transactivation of TGZ-induced KLF4 expression .	[]
Furthermore , we found that stable silencing of KLF4 obviously suppressed the G1/S arrest and anti-proliferation effects induced by PPARÎ³ ligands .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Taken together , our data indicated that upregulating KLF4 upon PPARÎ³ activation is mediated through PPRE in KLF4 promoter , thus providing further insights into PPARÎ³ signal transduction pathway as well as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy .	[]
