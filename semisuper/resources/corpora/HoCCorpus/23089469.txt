Alteration of the oxidative stress of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) cells can influence the expressions of genes favored angiogenesis .	[]
Quinone reductase 2 which can activate quinones leading to reactive oxygen species production is a melatonin receptor known as MT3 .	[]
Prazosin prescribed for benign prostate hyperplasia and hypertension is a potent antagonist for MT3 .	[]
This study was to investigate the influence of therapeutic concentrations of prazosin ( 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M ) on cell proliferation and differential expressions of CCL2 , CCL20 , CXCL6 , CXCL10 , IL8 and IL6 genes related to inflammation and/or oxidative stress in human HCC cell lines .	[]
Two HCC cell lines including one without susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress ( cell line A ; HCC24/KMUH ) and one with this effect ( cell line B ; HCC38/KMUH ) were investigated by 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin .	[]
The premixed WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was applied for proliferation assay .	[]
Differential expressions of genes were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction .	[]
Our results showed that both 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin did not influence cell proliferation in both cell lines .	[]
Both 0.01 and 0.1Î¼M prazosin in cell line A and 0.01Î¼M prazosin in cell line B did not cause differential expressions of tested genes .	[]
However , 0.1Î¼M prazosin caused remarkable up-regulation of IL6 gene and slightly up-regulation of CCL2 gene in cell line B. In conclusion , high therapeutic concentration of prazosin can up-regulate angiogenic IL6 and CCL2 genes in human HCC cells susceptible to amphotericin B-induced oxidative stress .

Clinical application of prazosin in patients with HCC should consider this possibility .	[]
