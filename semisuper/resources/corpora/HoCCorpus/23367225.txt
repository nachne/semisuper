The new concept of keeping primary tumor under control in situ to suppress distant foci sheds light on the novel treatment of metastatic tumor .	[]
Hyperthermia is considered as one of the means for controlling tumor growth .	[]
In this study , a novel thermal modality was built to introduce hyperthermia effect on tumor to suppress its growth and progression using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma , a common animal model of metastatic breast cancer .	[]
A mildly raised temperature ( i.e.39ï¿½C ) was imposed on the skin surface of the implanted tumor using a thermal heating pad .	[]
Periodic heating ( 12 hours per day ) was carried out for 3 days , 7 days , 14 days , and 21 days , respectively .	[]
The tumor growth rate was found significantly decreased in comparison to the control without hyperthermia .	[]
Biological evidences associated with tumor angiogenesis and metastasis were examined using histological analyses .	[]
Accordingly , the effect of mild hyperthermia on immune cell infiltration into tumors was also investigated .	[]
It was demonstrated that a delayed tumor growth and malignancy progression was achieved by mediating tumor cell apoptosis , vascular injury , degrading metastasis potential and as well as inhibiting the immunosuppressive cell myeloid derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) recruitment .	['resisting cell death', 'activating invasion and metastasis', 'avoiding immune destruction']
Further mechanistic studies will be performed to explore the quantitative relationship between tumor progression and thermal dose in the near future .	[]
