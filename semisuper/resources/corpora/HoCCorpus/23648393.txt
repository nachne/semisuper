Understanding how arsenic exacts its diverse , global disease burden is hampered by a limited understanding of the particular biological pathways that are disrupted by arsenic and underlie pathogenesis .	[]
A reductionist view would predict that a small number of basic pathways are generally perturbed by arsenic , and manifest as diverse diseases .	[]
Following an initial observation that arsenite-exposed cells in culture acidify their media more rapidly than control cells , the report here shows that low level exposure to arsenite ( 75ppb ) is sufficient to induce aerobic glycolysis ( the Warburg effect ) as a generalized phenomenon in cultured human primary cells and cell lines .

Expanded studies in one such cell line , the non-malignant pulmonary epithelial line , BEAS-2B , established that the arsenite-induced Warburg effect was associated with increased accumulation of intracellular and extracellular lactate , an increased rate of extracellular acidification , and inhibition by the non-metabolized glucose analog , 2-deoxy-D-glucose .	['cellular energetics']
Associated with the induction of aerobic glycolysis was a pathway-wide induction of glycolysis gene expression , as well as protein accumulation of an established glycolysis master-regulator , hypoxia-inducible factor 1A .	['cellular energetics']
Arsenite-induced alteration of energy production in human cells represents the type of fundamental perturbation that could extend to many tissue targets and diseases .	[]
