Hormone-dependent estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancers generally respond well to anti-estrogen therapy .	[]
Unfortunately , hormone-independent estrogen receptor negative ( ER- ) breast cancers are aggressive , respond poorly to current treatments and have a poor prognosis .	[]
New approaches and targets are needed for the prevention and treatment of ER- breast cancer .	[]
The NF-ÎºB signaling pathway is strongly implicated in ER- tumor genesis , constituting a possible target for treatment .	[]
Hydrogen sulfide-releasing aspirin ( HS-ASA ) , a novel and safer derivative of aspirin , has shown promise as an anti-cancer agent .	[]
We examined the growth inhibitory effect of HS-ASA via alterations in cell proliferation , cell cycle phase transitions , and apoptosis , using MDA-MB-231 cells as a model of triple negative breast cancer .	[]
Tumor xenografts in mice , representing human ER- breast cancer , were evaluated for reduction in tumor size , followed by immunohistochemical analysis for proliferation , apoptosis and expression of NF-ÎºB .	[]
HS-ASA suppressed the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells by induction of G(0)/G(1) arrest and apoptosis , down-regulation of NF-ÎºB , reduction of thioredoxin reductase activity , and increased levels reactive oxygen species .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Tumor xenografts in mice , were significantly reduced in volume and mass by HS-ASA treatment .	[]
The decrease in tumor mass was associated with inhibition of cell proliferation , induction of apoptosis and decrease in NF-ÎºB levels in vivo .	[]
HS-ASA has anti-cancer potential against ER- breast cancer and merits further study .	[]
