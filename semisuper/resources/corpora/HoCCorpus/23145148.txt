Regulation of poly(ADP-ribose) ( PAR ) synthesis and turnover is critical to determining cell fate after genotoxic stress .	[]
Hyperactivation of PAR synthesis by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 ( PARP-1 ) occurs when cells deficient in DNA repair are exposed to genotoxic agents ; however , the function of this hyperactivation has not been adequately explained .	[]
Here , we examine PAR synthesis in mouse fibroblasts deficient in the base excision repair enzyme DNA polymerase β ( pol β ) .	[]
The extent and duration of PARP-1 activation was measured after exposure to either the DNA alkylating agent , methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ) , or to low energy laser-induced DNA damage .	[]
There was strong DNA damage-induced hyperactivation of PARP-1 in pol β nullcells , but not in wild-type cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
In the case of MMS treatment , PAR synthesis did not lead to cell death in the pol β null cells , but instead resulted in increased PARylation of the nonhomologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) protein Ku70 and increased association of Ku70 with PARP-1 .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Inhibition of the NHEJ factor DNA-PK , under conditions of MMS-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation , enhanced necrotic cell death .	['resisting cell death', 'genomic instability and mutation']
These data suggest that PARP-1 hyperactivation is a protective mechanism triggering the classical-NHEJ DNA repair pathway when the primary alkylated base damage repair pathway is compromised .	['genomic instability and mutation']
