The biological activities of tocotrienols are receiving increasing attention .	[]
Herein , we report the efficacy of a mixed-tocotrienol diet against prostate tumorigenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate ( TRAMP ) mouse model .	[]
Male TRAMP mice , 8 wk old , were fed 0.1% , 0.3% , or 1% mixed tocotrienols in AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	[]
Likewise , a positive control group consisting of male TRAMP mice and a negative control group consisting of wild-type nontransgenic mice were fed regular AIN-76A diet up to 24 wk old .	[]
Our results show that mixed-tocotrienol-fed groups had a lower incidence of tumor formation along with a significant reduction in the average wet weight of genitourinary apparatus .	[]
Furthermore , mixed tocotrienols significantly reduced the levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions as compared to the positive controls .	[]
This decrease in levels of high-grade neoplastic lesions was found to be associated with increased expression of proapoptotic proteins BAD ( Bcl(2) antagonist of cell death ) and cleaved caspase-3 and cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors']
In contrast , the expression of cyclins A and E were found to be decreased in mixed-tocotrienol groups .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Taken together , our results show that by modulating cell cycle regulatory proteins and increasing expression of proapoptotic proteins , mixed tocotrienols suppress prostate tumorigenesis in the TRAMP mice .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
