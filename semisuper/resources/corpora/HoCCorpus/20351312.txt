Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are key regulators of innate and acquired immunity .	[]
The maturation of DCs is directed by signal transduction events downstream of toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) and other pattern recognition receptors .	[]
Here , we demonstrate that , in mouse DCs , TLR agonists stimulate a profound metabolic transition to aerobic glycolysis , similar to the Warburg metabolism displayed by cancer cells .	['cellular energetics']
This metabolic switch depends on the phosphatidyl inositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway , is antagonized by the adenosine monophosphate ( AMP)-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , and is required for DC maturation .	[]
The metabolic switch induced by DC activation is antagonized by the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Our data pinpoint TLR-mediated metabolic conversion as essential for DC maturation and function and reveal it as a potential target for intervention in the control of excessive inflammation and inappropriately regulated immune responses .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
