Bisphosphonates ( BPs ) are the current standard of care for bone lesions in patients with multiple myeloma ( MM ) but they are associated with a number of side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw .	[]
The exact mechanisms of osteonecrosis are not elucidated , and its physiopathology is based on several hypotheses such as a decrease in bone remodeling or an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis .	[]
The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis .	[]
We examined the apoptosis of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in MM subjects before and after BP treatment and in osteonecrosis patients using a flow-cytometric analysis .	[]
Our data showed an increase in endothelial cell apoptosis in MM patients after BP administration and in osteonecrosis subjects .	[]
Our study seems in agreement with the hypothesis that BPs can inhibit angiogenesis interfering with endothelial cell proliferation and survival , leading to loss of blood vessels and avascular necrosis .	['resisting cell death', 'inducing angiogenesis']
