BACKGROUND Estrogen receptor Î² ( ERÎ² ) is the predominant ER in the colorectal epithelium , whose expression is greatly reduced in colorectal cancer compared with normal colon tissue .	[]
Recent in vitro studies suggested that ERÎ² may suppress tumor growth .	[]
No research was reported whether ERÎ² can be used as therapeutic agent for colon cancer .	[]
METHODS In this study , ERÎ² gene constructed into adenoviral ( Ad ) vectors was used to treat colon cancer HCT-116 cells alone or in combination with raloxifene .	[]
In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of ERÎ² and raloxifene in HCT-116 cells .	[]
RESULTS Our results indicated that , although Ad-ERÎ² alone had no effect on the proliferation of HCT-116 cells , the combination of Ad-ERÎ² with raloxifene significantly inhibited the proliferation of HCT-116 cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The apparently apoptotic induction effects may partly explain the cytotoxicity of the two agents .	['resisting cell death']
The results of the study of ERÎ² on migration and invasion of HCT-116 cells demonstrated that overexpression of ERÎ² significantly decreased cell migration and increased invasion of cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The antitumor efficacies of ERÎ² as well as raloxifene were further investigated on HCT-116 tumor bearing mice .	[]
Results demonstrated that both Ad-ERÎ² and raloxifene individually inhibited tumor growth .	[]
The combination group showed the highest inhibitory efficiency compared with other three groups .	[]
CONCLUSION These findings demonstrated that combined administration of Ad-ERÎ² with raloxifene represents a promising colon cancer therapeutic strategy .	[]
