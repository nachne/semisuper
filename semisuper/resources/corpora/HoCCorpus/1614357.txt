Many human cellular and tissue compartments are supersaturated with respect to calcium oxyanion salts .	[]

We suggest that depletion of such systems , particularly in ageing organisms and under conditions of oxidative stress , plays an important role in degenerative and inflammatory diseases , including cancer .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
