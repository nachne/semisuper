Thyroid-like low-grade nasopharyngeal papillary adenocarcinoma ( LGNPPA ) is extremely rare ; only four cases have been reported .	[]
Herein are presented the case reports of two Japanese male patients with thyroid-like LGNPPA .	[]
Macroscopically , these tumors were pedunculated polypoid masses on the roof of the nasopharynx .	[]
Microscopically , they were characterized by papillary and glandular epithelial proliferation .	[]
The papillae were complex and tightly packed with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and lined by columnar and pseudostratified cells with intervening spindle-shaped cells .	[]
Both cell types had round to oval vesicular nuclei with tiny nucleoli and mildly eosinophilic cytoplasm .	[]
Mitotic figures were not evident and necrosis was not observed .	['resisting cell death']
Psammoma bodies were seen focally in one of the patients .	[]
Transition from normal surface epithelium to tumor cells was identified in both cases .	[]
On immunohistochemistry the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin ( CK)7 , CK19 , thyroid transcription factor-1 ( TTF-1 ) and vimentin .	[]
They were negative for CK5/6 , CK20 , thyroglobulin , S-100 protein and CD15 .	[]
In situ hybridization for EBV was negative .	[]
Nasopharyngeal tumors with similar morphological appearance should be examined for TTF-1 immunoreactivity , and patients should be clinically followed to determine the course of this unusual disease and the significance of TTF-1 expression .	[]
