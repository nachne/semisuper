Curcumin , a well-known chemopreventive agent from turmeric , inhibits the expression of several oncogenes and cell proliferation genes in tumor cells .	[]
This study aims to understand the precise molecular mechanism by which curcumin exerts its effects on retinoblastoma cells , by performing whole genome microarray analysis to determine the gene expression profiles altered by curcumin treatment .	[]
Curcumin suppressed cell viability and altered the cell cycle of retinoblastoma cells .	[]
We identified 903 downregulated genes and 1,319 upregulated genes when compared with the control cells after treatment with 20 Î¼M curcumin concentration for 48 h .	[]
These genes were grouped into respective functional categories according to their biological function .	[]
We found that curcumin regulated the expression of genes that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis , tumor suppressor , cell-cycle arrest , transcription factor , and angiogenesis .	['resisting cell death', 'inducing angiogenesis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) analysis was used to validate the results of genome array , and the results were consistent with the obtained data .	[]
In conclusion , treatment of curcumin affects the expression of genes involved in various cellular functions and plays an important role in tumor metastasis and apoptosis .	['resisting cell death', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
Thus , curcumin might be an effective chemopreventive agent for retinoblastoma cancer .	[]
