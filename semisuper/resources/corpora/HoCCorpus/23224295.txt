Kinins and their receptors have been recently implicated in cancer .	[]
Using functional and molecular approaches , we investigated the relevance of kinin B(1) and B(2) receptors in bladder cancer .	[]
Functional studies were conducted using bladder cancer cell lines , and human biopsies were employed for molecular studies .	[]
Both B(1) des-Arg(9)-BK and B(2) BK receptor agonists stimulated the proliferation of grade 3-derived T24 bladder cancer cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Furthermore , treatment with B(1) and B(2) receptor antagonists ( SSR240612 and HOE140 ) markedly inhibited the proliferation of T24 cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Only higher concentrations of BK increased the proliferation of the grade 1 bladder cancer cell line RT4 , while des-Arg(9)-BK completely failed to induce its proliferation .	[]
Real-time PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of kinin receptors , particularly B(1) receptors , was increased in T24 cells relative to RT4 cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Data from bladder cancer human biopsies revealed that B(1) receptor expression was increased in all tumor samples and under conditions of chronic inflammation .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
We also show novel evidence demonstrating that the pharmacological inhibition of PI3KÎ³ ( phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ) with AS252424 , concentration-dependently reduced T24 cell proliferation induced by BK or des-Arg(9)-BK .	[]
Finally , the incubation of T24 cells with kinin agonists led to a marked activation of the PI3K/AKT and ERK 1/2 signaling pathways , whereas p38 MAP kinase remained unaffected .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Kinin receptors , especially B(1) receptors , appear to be implicated in bladder cancer progression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
It is tempting to suggest that selective kinin antagonists might represent potential alternative therapies for bladder cancer .	[]
