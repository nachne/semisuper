Protein tyrosine kinase 6 ( PTK6 ) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cancers .	[]
Disruption of Ptk6 decreases azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice by preventing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation .	[]
Relocalization of PTK6 in prostate cancers contributes to increased growth .	[]
Although not expressed in normal breast or ovary , PTK6 promotes anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells .	[]
We identified several potential PTK6 substrates in the human SW620 colon cancer cell line using mass spectrometry , including FAK ( focal adhesion kinase ) .	[]
We show that FAK is a direct substrate of PTK6 in vitro and in vivo .	[]
Expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 ( Palm-PTK6-YF ) induces constitutive activation of FAK and cell morphology changes , which are independent of SRC family kinases in Src-/- , Yes-/- , Fyn-/- ( SYF ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) .	[]
Palm-PTK6-YF expressing SYF cells are transformed and overcome contact inhibition , form colonies in transformation assays , proliferate in suspension and form tumors in a xenograft model .	['evading growth suppressors']
Expression of FAK and Palm-PTK6-YF in Fak-/- MEFs synergistically activates AKT and protects cells against anoikis .	[]
However , expression of Palm-PTK6-YF in Akt1/2-/- MEFs fails to protect cells from anoikis , indicating AKT is critical in PTK6 and FAK-mediated survival signaling .	[]
In a conditional Pten knockout murine prostate cancer model , we identify prostate epithelial cells with enhanced activation of endogenous PTK6 and FAK at the plasma membrane .	[]
Knockdown of PTK6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line disrupts FAK and AKT activation and promotes anoikis , which can be rescued by exogenous expression of FAK .	[]
Our data reveal important roles for a PTK6-FAK-AKT signaling axis in promoting anchorage-independent cell survival .	[]
