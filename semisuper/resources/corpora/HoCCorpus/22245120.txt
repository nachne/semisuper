Hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) is an organochlorine pesticide that acts as an endocrine disruptor in humans and rodents .	[]
The development of breast cancer strongly depends on endocrine conditions modulated by environmental factors .	[]
We have demonstrated that HCB is a tumor co-carcinogen in rats and an inducer of proliferation in MCF-7 cells , in an estrogen receptor Î± ( ERÎ±)-dependent manner , and of migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line .	[]
In the present study , we examined HCB effect on c-Src/human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER1 ) and ERÎ± signaling pathways in mammary glands and in N-nitroso-N-methylurea ( NMU)-induced mammary tumors in rats .	[]
Furthermore , we evaluated histopathological changes and serum hormone levels .	[]
Rats were separated into four groups : control , HCB ( 100 mg/kg b.w. ) , NMU ( 50 mg/kg b.w. ) and NMU-HCB .	[]
Our data show that HCB increases c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , and Y699-STAT5b and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in mammary glands .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
HCB also enhances Y537-ERÎ± phosphorylation and ERÎ±/c-Src physical interaction .	[]
In tumors , HCB also induces c-Src and HER1 activation , c-Src/HER1 association , as well as T308-Akt and Y699-STAT5b phosphorylation .	[]
In addition , the pesticide increases ERÎ± protein content and decreases p-Y537-ERÎ± levels and ERÎ±/c-Src association in tumors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
HCB increases serum 17-beta estradiol and prolactin contents and decreases progesterone , FSH and LH levels in rats without tumors , while the opposite effect was observed in rats with tumors .	[]
Taken together , our results indicate that HCB induces an estrogenic effect in mammary gland , increasing c-Src/HER1 and ERÎ± signaling pathways .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
HCB stimulates c-Src/HER1 pathway , but decreases ERÎ± activity in tumors , appearing to shift them towards a higher malignancy phenotype .	[]
