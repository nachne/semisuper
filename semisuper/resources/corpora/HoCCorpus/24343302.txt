Tumour cells primarily utilize aerobic glycolysis for energy production , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect .	[]
Its mechanism is not well understood .	[]
The tumour suppressor gene p53 is frequently mutated in tumours .	[]
Many tumour-associated mutant p53 ( mutp53 ) proteins not only lose tumour suppressive function but also gain new oncogenic functions that are independent of wild-type p53 , defined as mutp53 gain of function ( GOF ) .	[]
Here we show that tumour-associated mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect in cultured cells and mutp53 knockin mice as a new mutp53 GOF .	['cellular energetics']
Mutp53 stimulates the Warburg effect through promoting GLUT1 translocation to the plasma membrane , which is mediated by activated RhoA and its downstream effector ROCK .	['cellular energetics']
Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK/GLUT1 signalling largely abolishes mutp53 GOF in stimulating the Warburg effect .	['cellular energetics']
Furthermore , inhibition of glycolysis in tumour cells greatly compromises mutp53 GOF in promoting tumorigenesis .	['cellular energetics']
Thus , our results reveal a new mutp53 GOF and a mechanism for controlling the Warburg effect .	['cellular energetics']
