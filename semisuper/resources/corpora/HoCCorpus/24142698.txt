Pyruvate kinase M2 ( PKM2 ) is a key player in the Warburg effect of cancer cells .	[]
However , the mechanisms of regulating PKM2 are not fully elucidated .	[]
Here , we identified the protein-serine/threonine kinase PIM2 , a known oncogene , as a novel binding partner of PKM2 .	[]
The interaction between PIM2 and PKM2 was confirmed by multiple biochemical approaches in vitro and in cultured cells .	[]
Importantly , we found that PIM2 could directly phosphorylate PKM2 on the Thr-454 residue , resulting in an increase of PKM2 protein levels .	[]
Compared with wild type , PKM2 with the phosphorylation-defective mutation displayed a reduced effect on glycolysis , co-activating HIF-1α and β-catenin , and cell proliferation , while enhancing mitochondrial respiration of cancer cells .	['genomic instability and mutation', 'cellular energetics']
These findings demonstrate that PIM2-dependent phosphorylation of PKM2 is critical for regulating the Warburg effect in cancer , highlighting PIM2 as a potential therapeutic target .	['cellular energetics']
