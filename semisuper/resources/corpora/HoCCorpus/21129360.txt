Tobacco-induced oxidative stress leads to chronic inflammation and is implicated in the development of many human epithelial cancers , including head and neck cancer .	[]
Cigarette smoke exposure was shown to induce the expression of the ÎNp63Î± and nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)-2 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells and immortalized oral keratinocytes .	[]
The NOS2 promoter was found to contain various cognate sequences for several transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor ( IRF)-6 and p63 , which were shown in vivo binding to the NOS2 promoter in response to smoke exposure .	[]
Small interfering ( si)-RNAs against both ÎNp63Î± and IRF6 decreased the induction of NOS2 promoter-driven reporter luciferase activity and were shown to inhibit NOS2 activity .	[]
Furthermore , both mainstream ( MSE ) and sidestream ( SSE ) smoking extracts induced changes in expression of autophagic marker , LC3B , while siRNA against ÎNp63Î± , IRF6 and NOS2 modulated these autophagic changes .	['resisting cell death']
Overall , these data support the notion that ÎNp63Î±/IRF6 interplay regulates NOS2 transcription , thereby underlying the autophagic-related cancer cell response to tobacco exposure .	['resisting cell death']
