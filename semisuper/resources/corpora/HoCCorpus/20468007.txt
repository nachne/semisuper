Regulation of adaptive immunity by innate immune cells is widely accepted .	[]
Conversely , adaptive immune cells can also regulate cells of the innate immune system .	[]
Here , we report for the first time the essential role of B cells in regulating macrophage ( MÏ ) phenotype .	[]
In vitro B cell/MÏ co-culture experiments together with experiments in transgenic mice models for B-cell deficiency or overexpression showed B1 cells to polarize MÏ to a distinct phenotype .	[]
This was characterized by downregulated TNF-Î± , IL-1Î² and CCL3 , but upregulated IL-10 upon LPS stimulation ; constitutive expression of M2 MÏ markers ( e.g .	[]
Ym1 , Fizz1 ) and overexpression of TRIF-dependent cytokines ( IFN-Î² , CCL5 ) .	[]
Mechanistically , this phenotype was linked to a defective NF-ÎºB activation , but a functional TRIF/STAT1 pathway .	[]
B1-cell-derived IL-10 was found to be instrumental in the polarization of these MÏ .	[]
Finally , in vivo relevance of B1-cell-induced MÏ polarization was confirmed using the B16 melanoma tumor model where adoptive transfer of B1 cells induced an M2 polarization of tumor-associated MÏ .	[]
Collectively , our results define a new mechanism of MÏ polarization wherein B1 cells play a key role in driving MÏ to a unique , but M2-biased phenotype .	[]
Future studies along these lines may lead to targeting of B1 cells to regulate MÏ response in inflammation and cancer .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
