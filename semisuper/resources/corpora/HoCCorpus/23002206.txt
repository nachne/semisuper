TGF-Î² derived from bone fuels melanoma bone metastases by inducing tumor secretion of prometastatic factors that act on bone cells to change the skeletal microenvironment .	[]
Halofuginone is a plant alkaloid derivative that blocks TGF-Î² signaling with antiangiogenic and antiproliferative properties .	[]
Here , we show for the first time that halofuginone therapy decreases development and progression of bone metastasis caused by melanoma cells through the inhibition of TGF-Î² signaling .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Halofuginone treatment of human melanoma cells inhibited cell proliferation , phosphorylation of SMAD proteins in response to TGF-Î² , and TGF-Î²-induced SMAD-driven transcription .	[]
In addition , halofuginone reduced expression of TGF-Î² target genes that enhance bone metastases , including PTHrP , CTGF , CXCR4 , and IL11 .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Also , cell apoptosis was increased in response to halofuginone .	['resisting cell death']
In nude mice inoculated with 1205Lu melanoma cells , a preventive protocol with halofuginone inhibited bone metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The beneficial effects of halofuginone treatment were comparable with those observed with other anti-TGF-Î² strategies , including systemic administration of SD208 , a small-molecule inhibitor of TGF-Î² receptor I kinase , or forced overexpression of Smad7 , a negative regulator of TGF-Î² signaling .	[]
Furthermore , mice with established bone metastases treated with halofuginone had significantly less osteolysis than mice receiving placebo assessed by radiography .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Thus , halofuginone is also effective in reducing the progression of melanoma bone metastases .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Moreover , halofuginone treatment reduced melanoma metastasis to the brain , showing the potential of this novel treatment against cancer metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
