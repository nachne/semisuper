Trabecular meshwork ( TM ) cells have widely been used as an invitro model for glaucoma research .	[]
However , primary TM cells suffer the disadvantages of limited cell numbers and slow rates of proliferation .	[]
We discovered a spontaneously transformed bovine TM ( BTM ) cell line , BTM-28T .	[]
This cell line proliferated rapidly in low-glucose culture medium but also demonstrated contact inhibition in high-glucose culture medium .	['evading growth suppressors']
BTM-28T cells expressed key TM cell markers including α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) , laminin and collagen IV ( col IV ) .	[]
Also , 100nM dexamethasone ( DEX ) enhanced the formation of cross-linked actin networks ( CLANs ) in confluent BTM-28T cell cultures .	[]
Transforming growth factor beta 2 ( TGFβ2 ) induced the expression of fibronectin ( FN ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) , and connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) in our cell cultures .	[]
This cell line will be helpful to better understand the aqueous humor outflow pathway as related to the pathophysiology of glaucoma .	[]
