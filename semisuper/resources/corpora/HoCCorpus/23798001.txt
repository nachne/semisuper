Cellular senescence , an irreversible cell cycle arrest induced by a diversity of stimuli , has been considered as an innate tumor suppressing mechanism with implications and applications in cancer therapy .	[]
Using a targeted proteomics approach , we show that fibroblasts induced into senescence by expression of oncogenic Ras exhibit a decrease of global acetylation on all core histones , consistent with formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci .	['enabling replicative immortality']
We also detected clear increases in repressive markers ( e.g. &gt;50% elevation of H3K27me2/3 ) along with decreases in histone marks associated with increased transcriptional expression/elongation ( e.g .	[]
H3K36me2/3 ) .	[]
Despite the increases in repressive marks of chromatin , 179 loci ( of 2206 total ) were found to be upregulated by global quantitative proteomics .	[]
The changes in the cytosolic proteome indicated an upregulation of mitochondrial proteins and downregulation of proteins involved in glycolysis .	['cellular energetics']
These alterations in primary metabolism are opposite to the well-known Warburg effect observed in cancer cells .	['cellular energetics']
This study significantly improves our understanding of stress-induced senescence and provides a potential application for triggering it in antiproliferative strategies that target the primary metabolism in cancer cells .	['enabling replicative immortality']
