PURPOSE BMP-6 , which belongs to the TGF-Î² superfamily , is a multifunctional molecule with distinct abilities in embryogenesis and organogenesis .	[]
Our recent research has implied that BMP-6 may suppress breast cancer metastasis .	[]
In the present study , we extended to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BMP-6 exerts its anti-tumorigenic effect .	[]
METHODS The Boyden chamber assay was used to examine the ability of BMP-6 and HO-1 in MCF-7 malignant progress .	[]
RT-PCR , western blot , luciferase assay , and quantitative CHIP were used to determine the potential mechanism and signaling pathways by which BMP-6 and HO-1 function as anti-metastatic factors in MCF-7 cells .	[]
RESULTS The Boyden chamber assay showed that BMP-6 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells , which effect was significantly deprived by knockdown of HO-1 .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
We further demonstrated that BMP-6 treatment resulted in an activation of HO-1 transcription through the recruitment of Smad1/5 to the Smad-responsive element on its promoter .	[]
In addition , BMP-6-induced up-regulation of HO-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on MMP-9 secretion in a paracrine action in MCF-7 cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Overexpression of BMP-6 and HO-1 synergistically suppressed MMP-9 transcription , which effect was specifically mediated via the MAPK/p38/AP-1 signaling .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
However , blockade of HO-1 using ZnPPIX totally abolished BMP-6-regulated MMP-9 activation in MCF-7 cells .	[]
CONCLUSIONS These observations suggest a novel role of BMP-6/HO-1 cascade to relieve breast cancer metastasis by regulating the secretion of growth factors in tumor microenvironment .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
