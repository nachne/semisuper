The tumor suppressors Lats1 and Lats2 are mediators of the Hippo pathway that regulates tissue growth and proliferation .	[]
Their N-terminal non-kinase regions are distinct except for Lats conserved domains 1 and 2 ( LCD1 and LCD2 ) , which may be important for Lats1/2-specific functions .	[]
Lats1 knockout mice were generated by disrupting the N-terminal region containing LCD1 ( Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) ) .	[]
Some Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) mice were born safely and grew normally .	[]
However , mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) from Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) mice displayed mitotic defects , centrosomal overduplication , chromosomal misalignment , multipolar spindle formation , chromosomal bridging and cytokinesis failure .	[]
They also showed anchorage-independent growth and continued cell cycles and cell growth , bypassing cell-cell contact inhibition similar to tumor cells .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) MEFs produced tumors in nude mice after subcutaneous injection , although the tumor growth rate was much slower than that of ordinary cancer cells .	[]
Yap , a key transcriptional coactivator of the Hippo pathway , was overexpressed and stably retained in Lats1(ΔN/ΔN) MEFs in a cell density independent manner , and Lats2 mRNA expression was downregulated .	[]
In conclusion , N-terminally truncated Lats1 induced Lats2 downregulation and Yap protein accumulation , leading to chromosomal instability and tumorigenesis .	['genomic instability and mutation']
