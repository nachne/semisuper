Chronic inflammation is a risk factor for the development of colon cancer , providing genotoxic insults , growth and pro-angiogenic factors that can promote tumorigenesis and tumor growth .	[]
Immunomodulatory agents can interfere with the inflammation that feeds cancer , but their impact on the transformed cell is poorly understood .	[]
The calcium/calcineurin signaling pathway , through activation of NFAT , is essential for effective immune responses , and its inhibitors cyclosporin A ( CsA ) and FK506 are used in the clinics to suppress immunity .	[]
Moreover , the kinases GSK3Î² and mTOR , modulated by PI-3K/Akt , can inhibit NFAT activity , suggesting a cross-talk between the calcium and growth factor signaling pathways .	[]
Both NFAT and mTOR activity have been associated with tumorigenesis .	[]
We therefore investigated the impact of calcineurin and PI-3K/mTOR inhibition in growth of human colon carcinoma cells .	[]
We show that despite the efficient inhibition of NFAT1 activity , FK506 promotes tumor growth , whereas CsA inhibits it due to a delay in cell cycle progression and induction of necroptosis .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
We found NFÎºB activation and mTORC1 activity not to be altered by CsA or FK506 .	[]
Similarly , changes to mitochondrial homeostasis were equivalent upon treatment with these drugs .	[]
We further show that , in our model , NFAT1 activation is not modulated by PI3K/mTOR .	[]
We conclude that CsA slows cell cycle progression and induces necroptosis of human carcinoma cell lines in a TGFÎ²- , NFAT- , NFÎºB- and PI3K/mTOR-independent fashion .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Nevertheless , our data suggest that CsA , in addition to its anti-inflammatory capacity , may target transformed colon and esophagus carcinoma cells without affecting non-transformed cells , promoting beneficial tumoristatic effects .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
