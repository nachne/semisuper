DNA repair is an essential cellular process required to maintain genomic stability .	[]
Every cell is subjected to thousands of DNA lesions daily under normal physiological conditions .	[]
Ionizing radiation ( IR ) is a major DNA damaging agent that can be produced by both natural and man-made sources .	[]
A common source of radiation exposure is through its use in medical diagnostics or treatments such as for cancer radiotherapy where relatively high doses are received by patients .	[]
To understand the detailed DNA repair gene transcription response to high dose IR , gene expression exon array studies have been performed and the response to radiation in two divergent cell types , lymphoblastoid cell lines and primary fibroblasts , has been examined .	[]
These exon arrays detect expression levels across the entire gene , and have the advantage of high sensitivity and the ability to identify alternative transcripts .	[]
We found a selection of DNA repair genes , including some not previously reported , that are modulated in response to radiation .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Detailed dose and time course kinetics of DNA repair transcription was conducted and results have been validated utilizing PCR methods .	[]
Alternative transcription products in response to IR were identified in several DNA repair genes including RRM2B and XPC where alternative initiation sites were found .	['genomic instability and mutation']
These investigations have advanced the knowledge about the transcriptional response of DNA repair .	['genomic instability and mutation']
