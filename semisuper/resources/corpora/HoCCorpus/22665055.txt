Cancer cells typically display altered glucose metabolism characterized by a preference of aerobic glycolysis , known as the Warburg effect , which facilitates cell proliferation .	[]
Hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF ) and oncoprotein Myc are two prominent transcription factors that drive glycolysis .	[]
Previously , we reported that the estrogen-related receptors ( ERRs ) act as cofactors of HIF and enhance HIF-dependent transcription of glycolytic genes under hypoxia .	[]
ERRs are orphan nuclear receptors and key regulators of energy metabolism by orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis , fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) and oxidative phosphorylation .	[]
Here , we show that ERRs also stimulate glycolysis under normoxia .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
ERRs directly bind to and activate promoters of many genes encoding glycolytic enzymes , and the ERR-binding sites in such promoters are essential for ERR-mediated transcriptional activation .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
ERRs interact with Myc , and the two factors synergistically activate transcription of glycolytic genes .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
Furthermore , overexpression of ERRs increases glycolytic gene expression and lactate production .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
Conversely , depletion of ERRs in cancer cells reduces expression of glycolytic genes and glucose uptake , resulting in decreased aerobic glycolysis and cell growth .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
Taken together , these results suggest that ERRs are important transcriptional activators of the glycolytic pathway and contribute to the Warburg effect in cancer cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling', 'cellular energetics']
