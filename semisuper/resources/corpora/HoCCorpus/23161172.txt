Olfactomedin 4 ( OLFM4 ) is highly expressed in gastrointestinal cancers and has an anti-apoptotic function .	[]
The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive .	[]
We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system .	[]
Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
However , it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells , i.e. , intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression , we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) , both of which are involved in tumor progression .	[]
Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin Î±1 , integrin Î±4 , integrin Î±5 , integrin Î±6 , and MMP9 .	[]
Moreover , forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
