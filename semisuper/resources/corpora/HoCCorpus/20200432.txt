Previous epidemiologic observational and experimental studies investigated the potential of antioxidant micronutrients to modulate cancer risk , but these studies produced inconsistent results .	[]
In this pilot , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial ( n = 47 ) , we assessed the effects of an antioxidant micronutrient combination ( 800 mg dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate , 24 mg beta-carotene , 1.0 g vitamin C , 200 microg l-selenomethionine , 7.2 mg riboflavin , 80 mg niacin , 60 mg zinc , 5 mg manganese ) given daily over 4 months on oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers in patients with a history of sporadic colorectal adenoma .	[]
Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , interleukin-6 , and F2-isoprostane concentrations were measured using ELISAs , and cystine ( CySS ) was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography .	[]
Plasma TNF-alpha concentration decreased in the active treatment group by 37% relative to the placebo group ( P = 0.002 ) , and CySS decreased by 19% ( P = 0.03 ) ; however , interleukin-6 and F2-isoprostane concentrations decreased in antioxidant-treated nonsmokers but increased in smokers , although these findings were not statistically significant .	[]
The decreases of TNF-alpha and CySS were more pronounced in nonsmokers .	[]
These data suggest that ( a ) an antioxidant micronutrient cocktail can modulate biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation in humans and ( b ) the effects of antioxidant micronutrient supplementation on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress may differ according to smoking status .
