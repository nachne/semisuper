BACKGROUND Î-Ionizing radiation ( IR ) therapy is one of major therapeutic tools in cancer treatment .	[]
Nevertheless , Î³-IR therapy failed due to occurrence of metastasis , which constitutes a significant obstacle in cancer treatment .	[]
The main aim of this investigation was to construct animal model which present metastasis during radiotherapy in a mouse system in vivo and establishes the molecular mechanisms involved .	[]
MATERIALS AND METHODS The C6L transfectant cell line expressing firefly luciferase ( fLuc ) was treated with Î³-IR , followed by immunoblotting , zymography and invasion assay in vitro .	[]
We additionally employed the C6L transfectant cell line to construct xenografts in nude mice , which were irradiated with Î³-IR .	[]
Irradiated xenograft-containing mice were analyzed via survival curves , measurement of tumor size , and bioluminescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo .	[]
Metastatic lesions in organs of mice were further assessed using RT-PCR , H &amp ; E staining and immunohistochemistry .	[]
RESULTS Î³-IR treatment of C6L cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) and increased cell invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In irradiated xenograft-containing mice , tumor sizes were decreased dramatically and survival rates extended .	[]
Almost all non-irradiated xenograft-containing control mice had died within 4 weeks .	[]
However , we also observed luminescence signals in about 22.5% of Î³-IR-treated mice .	[]
Intestines or lungs of mice displaying luminescence signals contained several lesions , which expressed the fLuc gene and presented histological features of cancer tissues as well as expression of EMT markers .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS These findings collectively indicate that occurrences of metastases during Î³-IR treatment accompanied induction of EMT markers , including increased MMP activity .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Establishment of a murine metastasis model during Î³-IR treatment should aid in drug development against cancer metastasis and increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
