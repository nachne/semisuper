BACKGROUND Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive form of malignant glioma and is very difficult to treat .	[]
Controlling tumour cell invasion and angiogenesis is essential to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma patients .	[]
Since constitutive activation of nuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) is necessary for tumour progression , NF-ÎºB may be an important pharmacological target for this disease .	[]
Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumour effects of parthenolide , a NF-ÎºB inhibitor , in two human glioblastoma cell lines ( U87MG and U373 ) and in glioblastoma xenografts .	[]
Furthermore , we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects .	[]
METHODS The anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of parthenolide were analysed using in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays .	[]
Parthenolide-induced growth inhibition of glioblastoma cells in vitro was determined using the MTT ( methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium ) assay .	[]
In addition , the effect of parthenolide on orthotropic implantation in vivo was evaluated using an intracerebral human glioblastoma xenograft model .	[]
RESULTS We found that parthenolide suppresses proliferation , invasion , and tumour- induced angiogenesis of glioblastoma cells .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Molecular studies demonstrated that parthenolide suppresses gene and protein expression of angiogenic factors .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Furthermore , parthenolide reduced Akt phosphorylation and activated mitochondrial signalling , suggesting that the antitumour function of parthenolide may be mediated not only by the inhibition of NF-ÎºB but also by the inhibition of Akt signalling and the activation of apoptotic proteins .	['resisting cell death']
Parthenolide suppressed neovascularity and tumour growth in glioblastoma xenografts .	[]
CONCLUSION The present study identified parthenolide as a new therapeutic agent for glioblastomas .	[]
