CDA-2 ( cell differentiation agent 2 ) , a urinary preparation , has potent anti- proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties in cancer cells .	[]
However , the mechanisms of tumor inhibitory action of CDA-2 are far from clear , and especially there was no report on lung cancer .	[]
Here we demonstrate that CDA-2 and its main component phenylacetylglutamine ( PG ) reduce the metastatic lung tumor growth , and increases survival time after inoculation with Lewis lung carcinoma ( LLC ) cells in a dose-dependent manner in C57BL6 mice .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Proliferative program analysis in cancer cells revealed a fundamental impact of CDA-2 and PG on proliferation and apoptosis , including Bcl-2 , Bcl-XL , cIAP1 , Survivin , PCNA , Ki-67 proteins and TUNEL assays .	['resisting cell death']
CDA-2 and PG significantly reduced NF-ÎºB DNA-binding activity in lung cancer cells and in alveolar macrophages of tumor bearing mice and especially decreased the release of inflammatory factors including TNFÎ± , IL-6 , and KC .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Furthermore , CDA-2 and PG decrease the expressions of TLR2 , TLR6 , and CD14 , but not TLR1 , TLR3 , TLR4 , and TLR9 in bone-marrow-derived macrophages ( BMDM ) of mice stimulated by LLC-conditioned medium ( LLC-CM ) .	[]
Over-expressing TLR2 in BMDM prevented CDA-2 and PG from inhibiting NF-ÎºB activation , as well as induction of TNFÎ± and IL-6 .	[]
TLR2:TLR6 complexes mediate the effect of NF-ÎºB inactivation by CDA-2 .	[]
In conclusion , CDA-2 potently inhibits lung tumor development by reduction of the inflammation in lung through suppression of NF-ÎºB activation in myeloid cells , associating with modulation of TLR2 signaling .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
