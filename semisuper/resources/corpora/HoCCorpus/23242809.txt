MYC deregulation is common in human cancer .	[]
IG-MYC translocations that are modeled in EÎ¼-Myc mice occur in almost all cases of Burkitt lymphoma as well as in other B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders .	[]
Deregulated expression of MYC results in increased mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) signaling .	[]
As tumors with mTORC1 activation are sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition , we used everolimus , a potent and specific mTORC1 inhibitor , to test the requirement for mTORC1 in the initiation and maintenance of EÎ¼-Myc lymphoma .	[]
Everolimus selectively cleared premalignant B cells from the bone marrow and spleen , restored a normal pattern of B-cell differentiation , and strongly protected against lymphoma development .	[]
Established EÎ¼-Myc lymphoma also regressed after everolimus therapy .	[]
Therapeutic response correlated with a cellular senescence phenotype and induction of p53 activity .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Therefore , mTORC1-dependent evasion of senescence is critical for cellular transformation and tumor maintenance by MYC in B lymphocytes .	['enabling replicative immortality']
