The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood .	[]
We report that partitioning defective protein 3 ( Par3 ) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer , and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Interestingly , the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
However , loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability , disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and decreased cell-cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac-GTP pathway .	[]
Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3 , suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell-cell cohesion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
