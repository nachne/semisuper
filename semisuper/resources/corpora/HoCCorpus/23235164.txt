Liver resection is now widely accepted as a potentially curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis .	[]
However , the efficacy of surgical resection for gastric cancer liver metastasis(GLM)remains unclear .	[]
Based on our 18-year experience with 64 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for GLM , we discuss the indication and efficacy of surgical resection for GLM .	[]
From January 1993 to January 2011 , 73 patients underwent hepatectomy for GLM in the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery , Cancer Institute Ariake Hospital(Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research ) , Japan .	[]
The actuarial1 - , 3- , and 5-year overall survival rates and 1- , 3- , and 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of those 64 patients who achieved curative resections were 84 , 50 , and 37% , and 42 , 27 , and 27% , respectively .	[]
By multivariate analysis , serosal invasion of the primary gastric cancer and larger hepatic tumor(&gt;5 cm in diameter)were found to be independent indicators of poor prognosis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Based on the multivariate analysis results , all patients were divided into three groups no poor prognostic factor(n=38) , one poor prognostic factor(n=24) , and two poor prognostic factors(n=2) .	[]
The actuarial overall survival rates of each group were 63 , 36 , and 0% at 3 years , and 53 , 15 , and 0% at 5 years .	[]
GLM patients having hepatic tumors with the maximum diameter of &lt;5 cm , and without serosalinvasion of the primary gastric cancer , are the best candidates for hepatectomy .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
