Sirtuin proteins regulate diverse cellular pathways that influence genomic stability , metabolism and ageing .	[]
SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity , molecular targets and physiological functions have been unclear .	[]
Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD(+)-dependent H3K18Ac ( acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3 ) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of cancer cells .	[]
Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set of gene targets , where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression .	[]
The spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated E26 transformed specific ( ETS ) transcription factor ELK4 , and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression .	[]
Notably , selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation , and in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis .	[]
We find that deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human cancer cells , including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
Moreover , SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A .	[]
Finally , SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the tumorigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice .	[]
Together , our work establishes SIRT7 as a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin regulation , cellular transformation programs and tumour formation in vivo .	[]
