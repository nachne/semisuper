Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the most prevalent liver tumor and a deadly disease with limited therapeutic options .	[]
Dysregulation of cell signaling pathways is a common denominator in tumorigenesis , including hepatocarcinogenesis .	[]
The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signaling system is commonly activated in HCC , and is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic target in combination therapies .	[]
We and others have identified a central role for the EGFR ligand amphiregulin ( AR ) in the proliferation , survival and drug resistance of HCC cells .	[]
AR expression is frequently up-regulated in HCC tissues and cells through mechanisms not completely known .	[]
Here we identify the Î²-catenin signaling pathway as a novel mechanism leading to transcriptional activation of the AR gene in human HCC cells .	[]
Activation of Î²-catenin signaling , or expression of the T41A Î²-catenin active mutant , led to the induction of AR expression involving three specific Î²-catenin-Tcf responsive elements in its proximal promoter .	[]
We demonstrate that HCC cells expressing the T41A Î²-catenin active mutant show enhanced proliferation that is dependent in part on AR expression and EGFR signaling .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
We also demonstrate here a novel cross-talk of the EGFR system with fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
FGF19 is a recently identified driver gene in hepatocarcinogenesis and an activator of Î²-catenin signaling in HCC and colon cancer cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
We show that FGF19 induced AR gene expression through the Î²-catenin pathway in human HCC cells .	[]
Importantly , AR up-regulation and EGFR signaling participated in the induction of cyclin D1 and cell proliferation elicited by FGF19 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Finally , we demonstrate a positive correlation between FGF19 and AR expression in human HCC tissues , therefore supporting in clinical samples our experimental observations .	[]
These findings identify the AR/EGFR system as a key mediator of FGF19 responses in HCC cells involving Î²-catenin signaling , and suggest that combined targeting of FGF19 and AR/EGFR may enhance therapeutic efficacy .	[]
