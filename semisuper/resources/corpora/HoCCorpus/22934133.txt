We show that sufficient concentrations of gold nanoparticles produced by an original synthesis method in EMT-6 and CT-26 cancer cells make it possible to detect the presence , necrosis and proliferation of such cells after inoculation in live mice .	[]
We first demonstrated that the nanoparticles do not interfere with the proliferation process .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Then , we observed significant differences in the tumor evolution and the angiogenesis process after shallow and deep inoculation .	['inducing angiogenesis']
A direct comparison with pathology optical images illustrates the effectiveness of this approach .	[]
