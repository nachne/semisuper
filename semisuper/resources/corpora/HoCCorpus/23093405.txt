In cancer , glucose uptake and glycolysis are increased regardless of the oxygen concentration in the cell , a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect .	[]
Several ( but not all ) glycolytic enzymes have been investigated as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment using RNAi .	[]
Here , four previously untargeted glycolytic enzymes , aldolase A , glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase , triose phosphate isomerase , and enolase 1 , are targeted using RNAi in Ras-transformed NIH-3T3 cells .	[]
Of these enzymes , knockdown of aldolase causes the greatest effect , inhibiting cell proliferation by 90% .	[]
This defect is rescued by expression of exogenous aldolase .	[]
However , aldolase knockdown does not affect glycolytic flux or intracellular ATP concentration , indicating a non-metabolic cause for the cell proliferation defect .	[]
Furthermore , this defect could be rescued with an enzymatically dead aldolase variant that retains the known F-actin binding ability of aldolase .	[]
One possible model for how aldolase knockdown may inhibit transformed cell proliferation is through its disruption of actin-cytoskeleton dynamics in cell division .	[]
Consistent with this hypothesis , aldolase knockdown cells show increased multinucleation .	[]
These results are compared with other studies targeting glycolytic enzymes with RNAi in the context of cancer cell proliferation and suggest that aldolase may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer .	['cellular energetics']
