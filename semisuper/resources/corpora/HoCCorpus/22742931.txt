Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide .	[]
Major risk factors of HCC include infection with hepatitis B or C viruses , alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease .	[]
HCC is difficult to diagnose at early stage , and has a very poor survival rate when diagnosed at a late stage .	[]
The majority of HCC-related deaths result from local invasion ( to cause liver failure ) or distant metastases .	[]
There is an urgent need to identify effective molecular targets for the treatment of the disease .	[]
As the target of an established class of therapeutic agent thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor Î³ ( PPARÎ³ ) has been widely studied for its role in the development of HCC .	[]
A substantial body of evidence based on in vitro and in vivo models indicates that the activation of PPARÎ³ is able to inhibit HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth through inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via the regulation of a panel of downstream effector molecules .	['resisting cell death', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
PPARÎ³ activation also induces an inhibitory effect on HCC metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Meanwhile , there is new evidence suggesting that PPARÎ³ inhibition could also be anti-tumorigenic .	[]
In the present review , we summarize the available information on the role of PPARÎ³ in HCC development and spread , and discuss whether PPARÎ³ activation by TZDs could play a role in the treatment of HCC , summarizing both in vitro and in vivo .	[]
Considering the available data , PPARÎ³ seems to exert beneficial effects against HCC and may therefore represent as a therapeutic target .	[]
