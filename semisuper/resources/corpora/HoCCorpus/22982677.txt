Contact inhibition is a crucial mechanism regulating proliferation in vitro and in vivo .	[]
Although it is generally accepted that contact inhibition plays a pivotal role in maintaining tissue homeostasis , the molecular mechanisms of contact inhibition are still not fully understood .	[]
FoxM1 is known as a proliferation-associated transcription factor and is upregulated in many cancer types .	[]
Vice versa , anti-proliferative signals , such as TGF-Î² and differentiation signals decrease FoxM1 expression .	[]
Here we investigated the role of FoxM1 in contact inhibition in fibroblasts .	[]
We show that protein expression of FoxM1 is severely and rapidly downregulated upon contact inhibition , probably by inhibition of ERK activity , which then leads to decreased expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .	['evading growth suppressors']
Vice versa , ectopic expression of FoxM1 prevents the decrease in cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 and causes a two-fold increase in saturation density indicating loss of contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
Hence , we show that downregulation of FoxM1 is required for contact inhibition by regulating expression of cyclin A and polo-like kinase 1 .	['evading growth suppressors']
