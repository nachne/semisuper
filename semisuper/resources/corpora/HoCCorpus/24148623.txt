Glioblastoma multiforme is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults .	[]
Overexpression of the EGF receptor ( EGFR ) is recognized as a widespread oncogenic signature in glioblastoma multiforme , but the complexity of its contributions is not fully understood , nor the most effective ways to leverage anti-EGFR therapy in this setting .	[]
Hypoxia is known to drive the aggressive character of glioblastoma multiforme by promoting aerobic glycolysis rather than pyruvate oxidation carried out in mitochondria ( OXPHOS ) , a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect , which is a general feature of oncogenesis .	[]
In this study , we report that hypoxia drives expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase ( PDK1 ) and EGFR along with the hypoxia-inducing factor ( HIF)-1α in human glioblastoma multiforme cells .	[]
PDK1 is a HIF-1-regulated gene and our findings indicated that hypoxia-induced PDK1 expression may promote EGFR activation , initiating a feed-forward loop that can sustain malignant progression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
RNAi-mediated attenuation of PDK1 and EGFR lowered PDK1-EGFR activation and decreased HIF-1α expression , shifting the Warburg phenotype to OXPHOS and inhibiting glioblastoma multiforme growth and proliferation .	['cellular energetics']
In clinical specimens of glioblastoma multiforme , we found that immunohistochemical expression of PDK1 , EGFR , and HIF-1α were elevated in glioblastoma multiforme specimens when compared with normal brain tissues .	[]
Collectively , our studies establish PDK1 as a key driver and candidate therapeutic target in glioblastoma multiforme .	[]
