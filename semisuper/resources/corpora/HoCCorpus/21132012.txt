Monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) to HER2 are currently used to treat breast cancer , but low clinical efficacy , along with primary and acquired resistance to therapy , commonly limit clinical applications .	[]
We previously reported that combinations of antibodies directed at non-overlapping epitopes of HER2 are endowed with enhanced antitumor effects , probably due to accelerated receptor degradation .	[]
Here , we extend these observations to three-dimensional mammary cell models , and compare the effects of single mAbs with the effects of antibody combinations .	[]
Collectively , our in vitro assays and computational image analyses indicate that combining mAbs against different epitopes of HER2 better inhibits invasive growth .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Importantly , while growth factors are able to reduce intraluminal apoptosis and induce an invasive phenotype , combinations of mAbs better than single mAbs can reverse the growth factor-induced phenotypes of HER2-overexpressing spheroids .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In conclusion , our studies propose that mAb combinations negate the biological effects of growth factors on invasive growth of HER2-overexpressing cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Hence , combining mAbs offers a therapeutic strategy , potentially able to enhance clinical efficacy of existing antireceptor immunotherapeutics .	[]
