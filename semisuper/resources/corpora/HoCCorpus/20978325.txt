INTRODUCTION The progressive growth of malignancies is accompanied by a decline in the immune response through mechanisms which are poorly understood .	[]
Apoptosis and induction of inflammation by tumor released cytokines as tumor escape mechanisms have been proposed to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis .	[]
METHODS Expression of Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Î± ) was analyzed in colorectal cancer specimen and the cancer cell line HT-29 by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR .	[]
TNF-Î± expression on protein and mRNA level were correlated with clinical characteristics and impact on survival .	[]
TNFR-1 was co-labelled with TNF-Î± and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in immunofluorescence double staining experiments .	[]
RESULTS 94% ( n=98/104 ) of the patients with CRC expressed TNF-Î± .	[]
High TNF-Î± expression was significantly associated with positive lymph node stage and recurrence of the tumor .	[]
Multivariate analysis revealed high TNF-Î± expression as an independent prognostic factor .	[]
Immunohistochemistry was correlated with RT-PCR results ( Ï=0.794 ) .	[]
Immunofluorescence double staining experiments revealed increased TNFR-1 expression by CD8+ cells .	[]
CONCLUSIONS TNF-Î± expression by tumor cells may be an efficient immunological escape mechanism by inflammation-enhanced metastases and probably by induction of apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ immune cells resulting in a down regulation of the tumoral immune response .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Our data support the role of tumor-derived TNF-Î± expression as an important promoter of tumoral immune escape mechanisms and malignant progression , and suggest that analysis on either protein ( immunohistochemistry ) or RNA level ( RT-PCR ) can be used effectively in this respect .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Targeting TNF-Î± may be a promising option , especially in cases with high TNF-Î± expression and positive lymph node metastases .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
