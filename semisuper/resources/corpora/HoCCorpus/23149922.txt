More effective treatments for metastatic lung cancer remain a pressing clinical need .	[]
In this study , we identified migration inducting gene-7 ( MIG-7 ) protein as critical for COX-2/prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2)- and Akt/GSK-3Î²-dependent tumor invasion/metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
COX-2/PGE2 activated EP4 to enhance Akt and GSK-3Î² phosphorylation and Î²-catenin/T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor signaling leading to MIG-7 upregulation .	[]
RNAi-mediated attenuation of MIG-7 blocked COX-2/PGE2- and Akt/GSK-3Î²-mediated migration/invasion effects .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Furthermore , MIG-7 protein inhibited protein phosphatase 2A to sustain Akt/GSK-3Î² phosphorylation and cancer-cell migration/invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Cancer cells overexpressing MIG-7 exhibited increased expression of ZEB-1 and Twist in parallel with epithelial-mesenchymal transition , metastasis and cancer lethality .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
MIG-7 protein level positively correlated with advanced stages of human lung cancers .	[]
MIG-7 thus offers a theranostic target for cancer metastases arising from aberrant activation of the cellular COX-2/PGE2 and Akt/GSK-3Î² signaling pathways .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
