Construction industry workers are exposed to many known carcinogens in their complex occupational environment .	[]
Since there are no past studies on genotoxicity among this group in the Indian subcontinent , workers engaged in different construction sites at Coimbatore , Tamil Nadu , India , were assessed here .	[]
We enrolled 96 workers and 68 control subjects with similar mean age , smoking , tobacco chewing prevalence and alcohol consumption , for analysis of DNA damage in blood leucocytes by micronucleus ( MN ) and comet assays .	[]
DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing the XPD gene .	[]
Construction workers showed a significant increase in MN and comet tail length compared to controls with adjustment for smoking habits , tobacco chewing , alcohol consumption and years of exposure ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	[]
The results indicated that chronic occupational exposure to cement during construction work could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .	['genomic instability and mutation']
