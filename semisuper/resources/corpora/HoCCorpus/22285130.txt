High-grade gliomas ( HGG ) , are the most common aggressive brain tumours in adults .	[]
Inhibitors targeting growth factor signalling pathways in glioma have shown a low clinical response rate .	[]
To accurately evaluate response to targeted therapies further in vitro studies are necessary .	[]
Growth factor pathway expression using epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , mutant EGFR ( EGFRvIII ) , platelet derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , C-Kit and C-Abl together with phosphatase and tensin homolog ( PTEN ) expression and downstream activation of AKT and phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 ( P70S6K ) was analysed in 26 primary glioma cultures treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) erlotinib , gefitinib and imatinib .	[]
Response to TKIs was assessed using 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC(50) ) .	[]
Response for each culture was compared with the EGFR/PDGFR immunocytochemical pathway profile using hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCA ) and principal component analysis ( PCA ) .	[]
Erlotinib response was not strongly associated with high expression of the growth factor pathway components .	[]
PTEN expression did not correlate with response to any of the three TKIs .	[]
Increased EGFR expression was associated with gefitinib response ; increased PDGFR-Î± expression was associated with imatinib response .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
The results of this in vitro study suggest gefitinib and imatinib may have therapeutic potential in HGG tumours with a corresponding growth factor receptor expression profile .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
