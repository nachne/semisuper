We have previously shown that the antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid mifepristone inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells .	[]
In this work , we hypothesized that cellular stress caused by mifepristone is limited to cytostasis and that cell killing is avoided as a consequence of the persistent activity of the PI3K/Akt survival pathway.To investigate the role of this pathway in mifepristone-induced growth inhibition , human ovarian cancer cells of various histological subtypes and genetic backgrounds were exposed to cytostatic doses of mifepristone in the presence or absence of the PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 .	[]
The activation of Akt in ovarian cancer cells , as marked by its phosphorylation on Ser473 , was not modified by cytostatic concentrations of mifepristone , but it was blocked upon treatment with LY294002 .	[]
The combination mifepristone/LY294002 , but not the individual drugs , killed ovarian cancer cells via apoptosis , as attested by genomic DNA fragmentation and cleavage of caspase-3 , and the concomitant down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP .	['resisting cell death']
From a pharmacological standpoint , when assessing cell growth inhibition using a median-dose analysis algorithm , the interaction between mifepristone and LY294002 was synergistic .	[]
The lethality caused by the combination mifepristone/LY294004 in two dimensional cell cultures was recapitulated in organized , tri-dimensional spheroids .	[]
This study demonstrates that mifepristone and LY294002 , when used individually , cause cell growth arrest , yet when combined , they cause lethality .	[]
