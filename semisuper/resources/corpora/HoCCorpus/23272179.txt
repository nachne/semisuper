Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) is a major form of chronic inflammation that can frequently progress to colon cancer .	[]
Several studies have demonstrated massive infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages into the lamina propria and submucosa in the progression of UC-associated colon carcinogenesis .	[]
Macrophages contribute to the development of colitis-associated colon cancer ( CAC ) .	[]
However , the role of neutrophils is not well understood .	[]
To better understand the involvement of tumor-associated neutrophils ( TANs ) in the regulation of CAC , we used a mouse CAC model produced by administering azoxymethane ( AOM ) , followed by repeated dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) ingestion .	[]
This causes severe colonic inflammation and subsequent development of multiple tumors in mice colon .	[]
We observed that colorectal mucosal inflammation became increasingly severe with AOM and DSS treatment .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Macrophages infiltrated the lamina propria and submucosa , together with a marked increase in neutrophil infiltration .	[]
The chemokine CXCL2 increased in the lamina propria and submucosal regions of the colons of the treated mice , together with the infiltration of neutrophils expressing CXCR2 , a specific receptor for CXCL2 .	[]
This process was followed by neoplastic transformation .	[]
After AOM and DSS treatment , the mice showed enhanced production of metalloproteinase ( MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase ( NE ) , accompanied by excessive vessel generation and cell proliferation .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Moreover , CXCL2 promoted neutrophil recruitment and induced neutrophils to express MMP-9 and NE in vitro .	[]
Furthermore , administration of neutrophil-neutralizing antibodies after the last DSS cycle markedly reduced the number and size of tumors and decreased the expression of CXCR2 , CXCL2 , MMP-9 , and NE .	[]
These observations indicate a crucial role for TANs in the initiation and progression of CAC and suggest that the CXCL2-CXCR2 axis might be useful in reducing the risk of UC-associated colon cancer .	[]
