The tumor suppressor p27(Kip1) is an inhibitor of cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ) complexes and plays a crucial role in cell cycle regulation .	[]
Nevertheless , p27 function in the tumorigenesis of the uterine cervix has been poorly defined .	[]
Some phenomenon hints that HPV E7 protein can enhance p27 expression , which is contradictory to HPV E7's property of increasing cell proliferation rate .	[]
So , in the present study , we have examined the effect of E7 on p27 expression .	[]
Though the levels of p27 are increased after HPV E7 expression , most of the p27 protein localized in the cytoplasm and have no function on cell cycle arrest and contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
The cell migration rate is elevated when p27 is high expression and located in cytoplasm .	[]
The results indicated that E7-p27 interaction not only abolished the p27's cell cycle inhibitory function by sequestering it to the cytoplasm , but also endow the cell with invasive property which is the feature of malignant cells .	['evading growth suppressors']
