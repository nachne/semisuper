It is commonly believed that neurons remain in G(0) phase of the cell cycle indefinitely .	[]
Cell-cycle re-entry , however , is known to contribute to neuronal apoptosis .	[]
Moreover , recent evidence demonstrates the expression of cell-cycle proteins in differentiated neurons under physiological conditions .	[]
The functional roles of such expression remain unclear .	[]
Since DNA repair is generally attenuated by differentiation in most cell types , the cell-cycle-associated events in postmitotic cells may reflect the need to re-enter the cell cycle to activate DNA repair .	[]
We show that cyclin-C-directed , pRb-dependent G(0) exit activates the non-homologous end joining pathway of DNA repair ( NHEJ ) in postmitotic neurons .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Using RNA interference , we found that abrogation of cyclin-C-mediated exit from G(0) compromised DNA repair but did not initiate apoptosis .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Forced G(1) entry combined with prevention of G(1) --&gt ; S progression triggered NHEJ activation even in the absence of DNA lesions , but did not induce apoptosis in contrast to unrestricted progression through G(1) --&gt ; S. We conclude that G(0) --&gt ; G(1) transition is functionally significant for NHEJ repair in postmitotic neurons .	['genomic instability and mutation']
These findings reveal the importance of cell-cycle activation for controlling both DNA repair and apoptosis in postmitotic neurons , and underline the particular role of G(1) --&gt ; S progression in apoptotic signaling , providing new insights into the mechanisms of DNA damage response ( DDR ) in postmitotic neurons .
