Dose-dense ( DD ) regimens of combination chemotherapy may produce superior clinical outcomes , but the basis for these effects are not completely clear .	[]
In this study , we assessed whether a DD combinatorial regimen of low-dose cisplatin and paclitaxel produces superior immune-mediated efficacy when compared with a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) regimen in treating platinum-resistant ovarian cancer as modeled in mice .	[]
Immune responses generated by the DD regimen were identified with regard to the immune cell subset responsible for the antitumor effects observed .	['avoiding immune destruction']
The DD regimen was less toxic to the immune system , reduced immunosuppression by the tumor microenvironment , and triggered recruitment of macrophages and tumor-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses to tumors [ as determined by interleukin ( IL)-2 and IFN-Î³ secretion ] .	['avoiding immune destruction']
In this model , we found that the DD regimen exerted greater therapeutic effects than the MTD regimen , justifying its further clinical investigation .	[]
Fourteen patients with platinum-resistant relapse of ovarian cancer received DD chemotherapy consisting of weekly carboplatin ( AUC2 ) and paclitaxel ( 60-80 mg/m(2) ) as the third- or fourth-line treatment .	[]
Serum was collected over the course of treatment , and serial IFN-Î³ and IL-2 levels were used to determine CD8(+) T-cell activation .	[]
Of the four patients with disease control , three had serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-Î³ associated with cytotoxic CD8(+) T-cell activity .	[]
The therapeutic effect of the DD chemotherapy relied on the preservation of the immune system and the treatment-mediated promotion of tumor-specific immunity , especially the antitumor CD8(+) T-cell response .	['avoiding immune destruction']
Because the DD regimen controlled drug-resistant disease through a novel immune mechanism , it may offer a fine strategy for salvage treatment .	['avoiding immune destruction']
