We studied the effect of oxidative stress induced by hyperoxia , hydrogen peroxide , or menadione on mouse leukemia P388 cells at early ( 4 days ) and late ( 7 days ) stages of tumor growth .	[]
Oxidative stress proved to inhibit cell division and to induce apoptosis .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']
Seven-day leukemia cells feature lower proliferative potential and higher sensitivity to oxidative stress and platidiam .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
