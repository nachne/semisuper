There are many growth factors influencing the expansion of multiple myeloma ( MM ) .	[]
Angiogenesis is a process that may enhance MM growth , in various manners .	[]
Among them , insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) is a major factor , acting in many levels .	[]
The aim of the study was to measure serum levels of IGF-1 in newly diagnosed MM patients and to correlate them with clinical stage of the disease and with markers of angiogenesis , such as vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and interleukin-6 and 15 ( IL-6 and IL-15 ) .	[]
Serum levels of the above factors were measured , by ELISA , in 57 newly diagnosed MM patients and in 20 healthy controls .	[]
There was no difference in serum levels of IGF-1 in MM patients and in controls , contrary to angiogenic factors , which were higher in MM patients ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Similarly , IGF-1 did not correlate with clinical stage of the disease nor the other angiogenic factors , which also correlated with each other ( p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Serum IGF-1 concentrations are not influenced in MM patients .	[]
Therefore , although it is a proliferation cytokine , it cannot be used as marker of disease activity .	[]
