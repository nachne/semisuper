Among several types of DNA lesions , the DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) are one of the most deleterious and harmful .	[]
Mammalian cells mount a coordinated response to DSBs with the aim of appropriately repair the DNA damage .	[]
Indeed , failure of the DNA damage response ( DDR ) can lead to the development of cancer-prone genetic diseases .	[]
The identification and development of drugs targeting proteins involved in the DDR is even more investigated , as it gives the possibility to specifically target cancer cells .	[]
Indeed , the administration of DNA repair inhibitors could be combined with chemo- and radiotherapy , thus improving the eradication of tumor cells .	[]
Here , we provide an overview about DSBs damage response , focusing on the role of the DSBs repair mechanisms , of chromatin modifications , and of the cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 which plays a multifunctional role in controlling genome integrity .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Moreover , the most investigated DSBs enzyme inhibitors tested as potential therapeutic agents for anti-cancer therapy are reported .	[]
