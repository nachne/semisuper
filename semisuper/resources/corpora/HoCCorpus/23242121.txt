Îuclear factor-ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) and activator protein-1 ( AP-1 ) are major transcription factors that have been associated with breast cancer metastasis by inducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) expression .	[]
In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effects of guggulsterone isomers ( cis or trans ) on 12-O-tetradecanoylpho-bol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression .	[]
Cis-guggulsterone inhibited TPA-induced MMP expression by blocking IÎºB kinase ( IKK)/NF-ÎºB signaling , whereas trans-guggulsterone blocked mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK)/AP-1 signaling .	[]
Cis-guggulsterone was more potent than trans-guggulsterone in the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion of MCF-7 cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Furthermore , we found that the combination of these isomers exerted an additive effect on the inhibition of MCF-7 cell invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
These results suggest that guggulsterone isomers downregulate MMP-9 expression and tumor cell invasion through the isomer-specific suppression of IKK/NF-ÎºB and MAPK/AP-1 activation .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In addition , the suppression of MMP-9 expression correlated well with the inhibition of cell invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
