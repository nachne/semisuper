Cellular senescence is a permanent out-of-cycle state regulated by molecular circuits acting during the G1 phase of the cell cycle .	[]
Cdt1 is a central regulator of DNA replication licensing acting during the G1 phase and it is negatively controlled by Geminin .	[]
Here , we characterize the cell cycle expression pattern of Cdt1 and Geminin during successive passages of primary fibroblasts and compare it to tumour-derived cell lines .	[]
Cdt1 and Geminin are strictly expressed in distinct subpopulations of young fibroblasts , similarly to cancer cells , with Geminin accumulating shortly after the onset of S phase .	[]
Cdt1 and Geminin are down-regulated when primary human and mouse fibroblasts undergo replicative or stress-induced senescence .	['enabling replicative immortality']
RNAi-mediated Geminin knock-down in human cells enhances the appearance of phenotypic and molecular features of senescence .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous for Geminin exhibit accelerated senescence compared to control fibroblasts .	['enabling replicative immortality']
In contrast , ectopic expression of Geminin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts delays the appearance of the senescent phenotype .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Taken together , our data suggest that changes in Geminin expression levels affect the establishment of senescence pathways .	['enabling replicative immortality']
