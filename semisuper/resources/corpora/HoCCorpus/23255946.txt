Piceatannol has potent anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anticancer and antiproliferative effects .	[]
However , little is known about the mechanism by which piceatannol inhibits invasion and metastasis .	[]
The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of piceatannol on the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) in DU145 human prostate cancer cells .	[]
The results revealed that MMP-9 activity was significantly increased in response to tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) .	[]
However , treatment with piceatannol reversed TNF-α- and MMP-9-induced gelatin zymography and its gene expression .	[]
In addition , a Matrigel invasion assay determined that piceatannol reduces the TNF-α-induced invasion of DU145 cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Nuclear factor-κ B ( NF-κB ) is a significant transcription factor that regulates numerous genes involved in tumor cell invasion and metastasis .	[]
Therefore , whether piceatannol acts on NF-κB to regulate MMP-9 gene expression was analyzed .	[]
The results revealed that piceatannol attenuates MMP-9 gene expression via the suppression of NF-κB activity .	[]
Using a specific NF-κB inhibitor , pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate , it was confirmed that TNF-α-induced MMP-9 gene expression is primarily regulated by NF-κB activation .	[]
Piceatannol inhibited NF-κB activity by suppressing nuclear translocation of the NF-κB p65 and p50 subunits .	[]
Furthermore , TNF-α-induced Akt phosphorylation was significantly downregulated in the presence of piceatannol .	[]
The Akt inhibitor LY294002 caused a significant decrease in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activity and MMP-9 gene expression .	[]
Overall , these data suggest that piceatannol inhibits TNF-α-induced invasion by suppression of MMP-9 activation via the Akt-mediated NF-κB pathway in DU145 prostate cancer cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
