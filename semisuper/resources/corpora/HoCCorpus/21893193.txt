Programmed cell death 6 ( PDCD6 ) was originally found as a pro-apoptotic protein , but its molecular mechanism is not well understood .	[]
In this study , we have attempted to investigate the effects of PDCD6 on the inhibition of angiogenesis-mediated cell growth as a novel anti-angiogenic protein .	[]
Purified recombinant human PDCD6 inhibited cell migration in a concentration-time-dependent manner .	[]
We also found that overexpressed PDCD6 suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF)-induced proliferation , invasion , and capillary-like structure tube formation in vitro .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
PDCD6 suppressed phosphorylation of signaling regulators downstream from PI3K , including Akt , mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , glycogen synthase kinase-3Î²(GSK-3Î²) , ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( p70S6K ) , and also decreased cyclin D1 expression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
We found binding PDCD6 to VEGFR-2 , a key player in the PI3K/mTOR/P70S6K signaling pathway .	[]
Taken together , these data suggest that PDCD6 plays a significant role in modulating cellular angiogenesis .	['inducing angiogenesis']
