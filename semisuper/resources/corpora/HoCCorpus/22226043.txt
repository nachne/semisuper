BACKGROUND The receptor tyrosine kinase family includes many transmembrane proteins with diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions .	[]
The involvement of tyrosine kinase signaling in promoting a more aggressive tumor phenotype within the context of chemotherapeutic evasion is gaining recognition .	[]
The Ron receptor is a tyrosine kinase receptor that has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and evasion of tamoxifen therapy .	[]
RESULTS Here , we report that Ron expression is correlated with in situ , estrogen receptor alpha ( ERÎ±)-positive tumors , and is higher in breast tumors following neoadjuvant tamoxifen therapy .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
We also demonstrate that the majority of mammary tumors isolated from transgenic mice with mammary specific-Ron overexpression ( MMTV-Ron mice ) , exhibit appreciable ER expression .	[]
Moreover , genetic-ablation of ERÎ± , in the context of Ron overexpression , leads to delayed mammary tumor initiation and growth , but also results in an increased metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS Ron receptor overexpression is associated with ERÎ±-positive human and murine breast tumors .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In addition , loss of ERÎ± on a Ron overexpressing background in mice leads to the development of breast tumors which grow slower but which exhibit more metastasis and suggests that targeting of ERÎ± , as in the case of tamoxifen therapy , may reduce the growth of Ron overexpressing breast cancers but may cause these tumors to be more metastatic .
