Cancer cells constantly adapt to oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) suppression resulting from hypoxia or mitochondria defects .	[]
Under the OXPHOS suppression , AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) regulates global metabolism adjustments , but its activation has been found to be transient .	[]
Whether cells can maintain cellular ATP homeostasis and survive beyond the transient AMPK activation is not known .	[]
Here , we study the bioenergetic adaptation to the OXPHOS inhibitor oligomycin in a group of cancer cells .	['cellular energetics']
We found that oligomycin at 100 ng/ml completely inhibits OXPHOS activity in 1 h and induces various levels of glycolysis gains by 6 h , from which we calculate the bioenergetic organizations of cancer cells .	['cellular energetics']
In glycolysis-dominant cells , oligomycin does not induce much energy stress as measured by glycolysis acceleration , ATP imbalance , AMPK activation , AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) , and cell growth inhibition .	['cellular energetics']
In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1 wild type cells , oligomycin induces 5-8% ATP drops and transient AMPK activation during the initial 1-2 h .	[]
After AMPK activation is completed , oligomycin-induced increase of acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation at Ser(79) is still detected , and cellular ATP is back at preoligomycin treatment levels by sustained elevation of glycolysis .	['cellular energetics']
Cell growth , however , is inhibited without an increase in cell death and alteration in cell cycle distribution .	[]
In OXPHOS-dependent LKB1-null cells , no AMPK activation by oligomycin is detected , yet cells still show a similar adaptation .	[]
We also demonstrate that the adaptation to oligomycin does not invoke activation of hypoxia-induced factor .	[]
Our data suggest that cancer cells may grow and survive persistent OXPHOS suppression through an as yet unidentified regulatory mechanism .	[]
