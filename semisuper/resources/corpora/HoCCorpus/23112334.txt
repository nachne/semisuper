Although regulatory T cells ( T(regs) ) are known to suppress self-reactive autoimmune responses , their role during T cell responses to nonself antigens is not well understood .	[]
We show that T(regs) play a critical role during the priming of immune responses in mice .	['avoiding immune destruction']
T(reg) depletion induced the activation and expansion of a population of low-avidity CD8(+) T cells because of overproduction of CCL-3/4/5 chemokines , which stabilized the interactions between antigen-presenting dendritic cells and low-avidity T cells .	[]
In the absence of T(regs) , the avidity of the primary immune response was impaired , which resulted in reduced memory to Listeria monocytogenes .	['avoiding immune destruction']
These results suggest that T(regs) are important regulators of the homeostasis of CD8(+) T cell priming and play a critical role in the induction of high-avidity primary responses and effective memory .	[]
