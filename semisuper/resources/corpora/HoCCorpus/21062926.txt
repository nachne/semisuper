PURPOSE Steroid hormones and growth factors affect lung cancer , and it is possible they act in concert to influence patient outcome .	[]
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN Primary lung tumors and normal lung tissue were analyzed for expression and localization of estrogen receptor Î± and Î²-1 ( ERÎ± and ERÎ² ) , aromatase , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , and epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) .	[]
RESULTS Tumors expressed higher levels of ERÎ² compared to matched normal lung , whereas the reverse was true of PR .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
High cytoplasmic ERÎ² expression was identified as an independent negative prognostic predictor of overall survival ( OS ; HR = 1.67 ) , and low total PR was identified as an independent negative predictor of time to progression ( TTP ; HR = 1.59 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
After adjusting for stage , age , sex , and smoking , combined high cytoplasmic ERÎ² and low total PR showed enhanced effects on OS ( HR = 2.64 ) and on TTP ( HR = 6.02 ) .	[]
Further effects on OS were observed when EGFR expression was included ( HR = 5.32 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Patients with low cytoplasmic ERÎ² , low aromatase , low EGFR , and high total PR had shorter OS than patients with the opposite pattern ( HR = 6.60 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Contribution of these markers to survival showed no significant sex differences in a multivariable model .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
ERÎ± was elevated in tumors but was not predictive of survival , and appears to represent a variant ERÎ± protein that is only recognized by a C-terminal antibody .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSIONS Hormonal and EGFR pathways together may contribute to lung cancer prognosis .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Lung tumors with high ERÎ²-1/low PR may define patients with aggressive biology .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
A validation study is necessary to fully assess the predictive value of these markers .	[]
