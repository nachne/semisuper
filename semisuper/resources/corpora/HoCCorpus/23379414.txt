UNLABELLED BACKGROUND Cell lines are very useful for clinical and basic research .	[]
Thus far , only 11 reports have documented the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell lines in the literature .	[]
Due to the scarcity of information , the establishment of an ovarian malignant tumor cell line with distinctive characteristics is particularly important to study this disease .	[]
Thus , this study was undertaken to establish and characterize a new human endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line of the ovary .	[]
METHODS The cell line NOMH-1 was established from an ovarian tumor of a 44-year-old woman .	[]
Features of the cell line studied included morphology , chromosome analysis , heterotransplantation , tumor markers , and chemosensitivity .	[]
RESULTS This cell line has been growing well for 232 months and subcultured more than 50 times .	[]
Monolayer cultured cells were polygonal in shape , showing a pavement-like arrangement and a tendency to stack without contact inhibition .	['evading growth suppressors']
They exhibited a human karyotype with a modal chromosomal number in the hypertriploid range .	[]
The cells could be transplanted into the subcutis of nude mice and produced tumors resembling the original tumor .	[]
NOMH-1 cells expressed both CEA and CA19-9 which were identified immunohistochemically in the original tumor and the heterotransplanted tumor .	[]
The cells were sensitive to paclitaxel , an agent commonly used in the treatment of gynecological cancers .	[]
CONCLUSIONS NOMH-1 is the first ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma cell line in which CEA and CA19-9 expression have been defined .	[]
This newly established cell line should be useful for investigating the characteristics of ovarian endometrioid adenocarcinoma .	[]
