OBJECTIVE This study describes a new method used in the clinical laboratory at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein to detect mutations in exons 8 and 17 of the KIT gene in patients with acute myeloid leukemia .	[]
METHODS Genomic DNA extraction was performed on 54 samples of peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients with acute myeloid leukemia .	[]
The extracted DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced , and the fragments were analyzed .	[]
RESULTS Within the analyzed samples , we detected four mutations in exon 8 , two mutations in exon 17 , and mutations or a double mutation in one sample .	['genomic instability and mutation']
CONCLUSION The tests detecting mutations in exon 8 and 17 on the KIT gene were successfully standardized .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The test is now included among the routine diagnostics employed for patients at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein clinical laboratory .	[]
