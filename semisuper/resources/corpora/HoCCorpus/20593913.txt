The soluble hexavalent chromium Cr ( VI ) used in industrial welding is an environmental contaminant widely recognized to act as a carcinogen , mutagen and teratogen towards humans and animals .	[]
The carcinogenic potential of metals is a major issue in defining human health risk from exposure .	[]
In the present investigation , 93 welders and 60 control subjects with similar mean ages , smoking prevalences and alcohol consumption were enrolled for DNA damage analysis in blood leucocytes by Micronucleus assay ( MN ) and the Comet assay .	[]
DNA repair inhibition was also analyzed by assessing XPD gene polymorphism .	[]
Welders showed a significant increase in micronucleated cells compared to controls with respect to their smoking habits and alcohol consumption , age and years of exposure ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	[]
Results indicated that the welders had a larger mean comet tail length than that of the controls ( P&lt;0.05 ) .	[]
The current study suggested that chronic occupational exposure to Cr ( VI ) during welding could lead to increased levels of DNA damage and repair inhibition .	['genomic instability and mutation']
