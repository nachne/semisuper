OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to immunohistochemically evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP)-1 , MMP- 2 , tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase ( TIMP)-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin in oral squamous cell carcinoma ( OSCC ) .	[]
Immunohistochemical staining of podoplanin-positive lymphatic vessel density ( LVD ) was also assessed .	[]
STUDY DESIGN Forty cases of OSCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry .	[]
RESULTS MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-1 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin were detected in each of the 40 OSCC cases .	[]
The expression of MMP-2 was significantly correlated with histologic grade .	[]
The expression of podoplanin was positively correlated with gender and negatively correlated with tumor size .	[]
A significant positive correlation was also detected between LVD and the presence of lymph node metastases , gender , age , and diameter of the lymph node ( if involved ) , as well as histologic grade .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS The results are suggestive of important roles that MMP-2 , MMP-10 , TIMP-2 , and podoplanin play in pathologic processes of OSCC , including invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Our findings also suggest that LVD may play a role in lymphatic metastasis and tumor progression .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
