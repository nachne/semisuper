Ultraviolet ( UV ) light induces DNA-damage checkpoints and mutagenesis , which are involved in cancer protection and tumorigenesis , respectively .	[]
How cells identify DNA lesions and convert them to checkpoint-activating structures is a major question .	[]
We show that during repair of UV lesions in noncycling cells , Exo1-mediated processing of nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) intermediates competes with repair DNA synthesis .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Impediments of the refilling reaction allow Exo1 to generate extended ssDNA gaps , detectable by electron microscopy , which drive Mec1 kinase activation and will be refilled by long-patch repair synthesis , as shown by DNA combing .	['genomic instability and mutation']
We provide evidence that this mechanism maybe stimulated by closely opposing UV lesions , represents a strategy to redirect problematic repair intermediates to alternative repair pathways , and may also be extended to physically different DNA damages .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Our work has significant implications for understanding the coordination between repair of DNA lesions and checkpoint pathways to preserve genome stability .	['genomic instability and mutation']
