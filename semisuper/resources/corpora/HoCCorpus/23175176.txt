Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) likely play a role in many cancers even in never-smokers .	[]
We tried to find a model to explain the relationship between variation in PAH-related DNA adduct levels among people with similar exposures , multiple genetic polymorphisms in genes related to metabolic and repair pathways , and nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) capacity .	[]
In 111 randomly selected female never-smokers from the Golestan Cohort Study in Iran , we evaluated 21 SNPs in 14 genes related to xenobiotic metabolism and 12 SNPs in eight DNA repair genes .	[]
NER capacity was evaluated by a modified comet assay , and aromatic DNA adduct levels were measured in blood by32P-postlabeling .	[]
Multivariable regression models were compared by Akaike's information criterion ( AIC ) .	[]
Aromatic DNA adduct levels ranged between 1.7 and 18.6 per 10(8) nucleotides ( mean : 5.8 Â± 3.1 ) .	['genomic instability and mutation']
DNA adduct level was significantly lower in homozygotes for NAT2 slow alleles and ERCC5 non-risk-allele genotype , and was higher in the MPO homozygote risk-allele genotype .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The sum of risk alleles in these genes significantly correlated with the log-adduct level ( r = 0.4 , p &lt ; 0.001 ) .	[]
Compared with the environmental model , adding Phase I SNPs and NER capacity provided the best fit , and could explain 17% more of the variation in adduct levels .	[]
NER capacity was affected by polymorphisms in the MTHFR and ERCC1 genes .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Female non-smokers in this population had PAH-related DNA adduct levels three to four times higher than smokers and occupationally-exposed groups in previous studies , with large inter-individual variation which could best be explained by a combination of Phase I genes and NER capacity .	['genomic instability and mutation']
