Gadd45a , the first well-defined p53 downstream gene , can be induced by multiple DNA-damaging agents , which plays important roles in the control of cell cycle checkpoint , DNA repair process and signaling transduction .	[]
Our previous findings suggested that Gadd45a maintains cell-cell adhesion and cell contact inhibition .	[]
However , little is known about how Gadd45a participates in the suppression of malignancy in human cancer cells .	[]
To examine the functions of Gadd45a in cell invasion and metastasis , we performed the adhesion , wound-healing and transwell assays in Gadd45a ( +/+ ) and Gadd45a ( -/- ) MEF cell lines .	[]
We found the adhesion , migration and invasive abilities were much higher in Gadd45a deficient cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
We furthermore applied high-throughput cDNA microarray analysis and bioinformatics analysis to analyze the mechanisms of Gadd45a gene in invasion and metastasis .	[]
Compared with the Gadd45a wild type cells , the Gadd45a deficient cells showed a wide range of transcripts alterations .	[]
The altered gene pathways were predicted by the MAS software , which indicated focal adhesion,cell communication,ECM-receptor interaction as the three main pathways .	[]
Real-time PCR was employed to validate the differentially expressed genes .	[]
Interestingly , we figured out that the deregulations of these genes are caused neither by genomic aberrations nor methylation status .	[]
These findings provided a novel insight that Gadd45a may involve in tumor progression by regulating related genes expressions .	[]
