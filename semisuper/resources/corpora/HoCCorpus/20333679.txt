It has been shown that injecting a suspension of IFN-Î³-secreting tumor cells results in their rejection .	[]
This effect has been attributed to IFN-Î³ preventing tumor stroma formation but not to a direct effect on the cancer cells .	[]
However , it is not known , which influence IFN-Î³ has on tumors with an established stroma .	[]
To address this question , the plasmacytoma cell line J558L was transduced with a vector allowing doxycycline-inducible IFN-Î³ gene expression .	[]
After the injection of the tumor cells into mice , IFN-Î³ was induced at different time points .	[]
Tumors did not grow when inducing IFN-Î³ immediately after tumor cell inoculation , while approximately half of the tumors were rejected when IFN-Î³ was induced in early established tumors within 2 weeks .	[]
Induction of IFN-Î³ 2-3 weeks after tumor cell inoculation was less efficient ( 0-17% rejection ) .	[]
IFN-Î³ induction in established tumors led to a reduction of CD146(+) endothelial cells and massive necrosis .	['resisting cell death']
Together , we show that vascularized tumors can be rejected by local IFN-Î³ expression , but that rejection of established tumors was less efficient over time .	['inducing angiogenesis']
This suggests that transplanted tumors became less susceptible to local IFN-Î³ treatment the better they are established .	[]
