Given the important role of CXCR4 in cancer metastasis , microenvironmental factors that modulate CXCR4 may have an impact on the process of tumor expansion .	[]
Hypoxia is a common feature of solid tumors and a significant microenvironmental factor that drives aggressive behavior .	[]
CXCR4 is upregulated in several cancer cells under hypoxic conditions , suggesting a relationship between tumor hypoxia and CXCR4 .	[]
However , the role of hypoxia in regulating CXCR4 in gastric cancer remains poorly understood .	[]
KATO III gastric cancer cells were exposed to hypoxia or normoxia .	[]
CXCR4 expression in cells transfected with shRNA specific for HIF-1Î± was investigated by western blotting and flow cytometry .	[]
Wound healing , migration and invasion assays were used to assess cell motility and the chemotactic response to CXCL12 , a major CXCR4 ligand .	[]
CXCR4 expression at the protein level and in the cell membrane was significantly increased in KATOIII cells following exposure to hypoxia .	[]
This upregulation of CXCR4 was implicated in increased cell motility and enhanced chemotactic responses ( migration and invasion ) to CXCL12 treatment in vitro .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The increases in CXCR4 expression and metastatic potential in gastric cancer cells exposed to hypoxia were blocked by HIF-1Î±-specific shRNA .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Our results indicate that hypoxia upregulates CXCR4 in gastric cancer cells in a HIF-1Î±-dependent manner , and that upregulation of CXCR4 plays a role in cancer cell migration and invasion .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Thus , disrupting the hypoxia-HIF-1Î±-CXCR4 axis could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer .	[]
