HGF signaling induces epithelial cells to disassemble cadherin-based adhesion and increase cell motility and invasion , a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) .	[]
EMT plays a major role in cancer metastasis , allowing individual cells to detach from the primary tumor , invade local tissue , and colonize distant tissues with new tumors .	[]
While invasion of vascular and lymphatic networks is the predominant route of metastasis , nerves also can act as networks for dissemination of cancer cell to distant sites in a process termed perineual invasion ( PNI ) .	[]
Signaling between nerves and invasive cancer cells remains poorly understood , as does cellular decision making that selects the specific route of invasion .	[]
Here we examine how HGF signaling contributes to PNI using reductionist culture model systems .	[]
We find that TGFÎ² , produced by PC12 cells , enhances scattering in response to HGF stimulation , increasing both cell-cell junction disassembly and cell migration .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Further , gradients of TGFÎ² induce migratory mesenchymal cells to undergo chemotaxis towards the source of TGFÎ² .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Interestingly , VEGF suppresses TGFÎ²-induced enhancement of scattering .	[]
These results have broad implications for how combinatorial growth factor signaling contributes to cancer metastasis , suggesting that VEGF and TGFÎ² might modulate HGF signaling to influence route selection during cancer progression .
