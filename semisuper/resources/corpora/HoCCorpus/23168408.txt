The vacuolar H+-ATPase ( V-ATPase ) , a multisubunit proton pump , has come into focus as an attractive target in cancer invasion .	[]
However little is known about the role of V-ATPase in cell death and especially the underlying mechanisms remain mostly unknown .	[]
We used the myxobacterial macrolide archazolid B , a potent inhibitor of the V-ATPase , as an experimental drug as well as a chemical tool to decipher V-ATPase related cell death signaling .	[]
We found that archazolid induced apoptosis in highly invasive tumor cells at nanomolar concentrations which was executed by the mitochondrial pathway .	['resisting cell death']
Prior to apoptosis induction archazolid lead to the activation of a cellular stress response including activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha ( HIF1alpha ) and autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
Autophagy was induced at low concentrations of archazolid that do not alter pH in lysosomes and was shown by degradation of p62 or fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes .	['resisting cell death']
HIF1alpha was induced due to energy stress shown by a decline of the ATP level and followed by a shut down of energy consuming processes .	[]
As silencing HIF1alpha increases apoptosis , the cellular stress response was suggested to be a survival mechanism .	['resisting cell death']
We conclude that archazolid leads to energy stress which activates adaptive mechanisms like autophagy mediated by HIF1alpha and finally leads to apoptosis .	['resisting cell death']
We propose V-ATPase as a promising drugable target in cancer therapy caught up at the interplay of apoptosis , autophagy and cellular/metabolic stress .	['resisting cell death']
