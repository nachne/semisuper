Members of the Orai family are highly selective calcium ion channels that play an important role in store-operated calcium entry .	[]
Among the three known Orai isoforms , Orai3 has gained increased attention , notably for its emerging role in cancer .	[]
We recently demonstrated that Orai3 channels are over-expressed in breast cancer ( BC ) biopsies , and involved specifically in proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	[]
Here , we investigate the downstream signaling mechanisms affected by Orai3 silencing , leading to the subsequent functional impact specifically seen in MCF-7 cancer cells .	[]
We report a correlation between Orai3 and c-myc expression in tumor tissues and in the MCF-7 cancer cell line by demonstrating that Orai3 down-regulation reduces both expression and activity of the proto-oncogene c-myc .	[]
This is likely mediated through the MAP Kinase pathway , as we observed decreased pERK1/2 levels and cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase after Orai3 silencing .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Our results provide strong evidence that the c-myc proto-oncogene is influenced by the store-operated calcium entry channel Orai3 through the MAP kinase pathway .	[]
This connection provides new clues in the downstream mechanism linking Orai3 channels and proliferation , cell cycle progression and survival of MCF-7 BC cells .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
