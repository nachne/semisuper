Metastatic breast tumors undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which renders them resistant to therapies targeted to the primary cancers .	[]
The mechanistic link between mtDNA ( mitochondrial DNA ) reduction , often seen in breast cancer patients , and EMT is unknown .	[]
We demonstrate that reducing mtDNA content in human mammary epithelial cells ( hMECs ) activates Calcineurin ( Cn)-dependent mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway , which induces EMT-like reprogramming to fibroblastic morphology , loss of cell polarity , contact inhibition and acquired migratory and invasive phenotype .	['evading growth suppressors', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
Notably , mtDNA reduction generates breast cancer stem cells .	[]
In addition to retrograde signaling markers , there is an induction of mesenchymal genes but loss of epithelial markers in these cells .	[]
The changes are reversed by either restoring the mtDNA content or knockdown of CnAÎ± mRNA , indicating the causal role of retrograde signaling in EMT .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Our results point to a new therapeutic strategy for metastatic breast cancers targeted to the mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway for abrogating EMT and attenuating cancer stem cells , which evade conventional therapies .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
We report a novel regulatory mechanism by which low mtDNA content generates EMT and cancer stem cells in hMECs.Oncogene advance online publication , 4 November 2013 ; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.467 .	[]
