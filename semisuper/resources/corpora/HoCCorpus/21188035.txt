Cyclin-dependent kinases are most extensively studied targets for cancer chemotherapy since the tumor cells exhibit false checkpoints and can proliferate even if the genome is compromised .	[]
Cyclin-dependent kinases ensure the tight regulation of the cell cycle execution by mediating phosphorylation of cellular proteins .	[]
Deregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 activity by cellular and external factors leads to many diseases like cancers .	[]
Different methods like radiolabeled , fluorescence and luminescence are available for screening of library of compounds against kinases .	[]
However , bioluminescent methods offer several advantages like low background and no effect of fluorescent compound interference .	[]
Present study is focused on development , optimization and validation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 assay which is suitable for identification potent and selective , ATP competitive and non-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 .	[]
The aim of present investigation was to optimize the assay for cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cylin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E with use of bioluminescence based biochemical reaction .	[]
Both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 which are cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E complexes , have different affinity for ATP .	[]
Therefore , both isoform analogs of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 were optimized separately .	[]
Optimum cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin A and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin E concentration were found to be 250 ng/well and 200 ng/well , respectively .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Optimum substrate ( histone H1 ) concentration was found to be 2.5 mg/ml for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2 analogs .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Optimum reaction time was found to be 20 min for both cyclin-dependent kinase 2/cyclin complexes .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
