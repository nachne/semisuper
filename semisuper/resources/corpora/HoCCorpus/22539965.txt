BACKGROUND The isothiocyanate sulforaphane ( SFN ) possesses interesting anticancer activities .	[]
However , recent studies reported that SFN promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) as well as DNA breakage .	[]
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We investigated whether SFN is able to damage RNA , whose loss of integrity was demonstrated in different chronic diseases .	[]
Considering the ability of SFN to protect from genotoxicity , we also examined whether SFN is able to protect from RNA damage induced by different chemicals ( doxorubicin , spermine , S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine , H(2)O(2) ) .	[]
We observed that SFN was devoid of either RNA damaging and RNA protective activity in human leukemic cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
It was able to potentiate the RNA damage by doxorubicin and spermine .	[]
In the first case , the effect was attributable to its ability of modulating the bioreductive activation of doxorubicin .	[]
For spermine , the effects were mainly due to its modulation of ROS levels produced by spermine metabolism .	[]
As to the cytotoxic relevance of the RNA damage , we found that the treatment of cells with a mixture of spermine or doxorubicin plus SFN increased their proapoptotic potential .	['resisting cell death', 'genomic instability and mutation']
Thus it is conceivable that the presence of RNA damage might concur to the overall toxic response induced by a chemical agent in targeted cells .	[]
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Since RNA is emerging as a potential target for anticancer drugs , its ability to enhance spermine- and doxorubicin-induced RNA damage and cytotoxicity could represent an additional mechanism for the potentiating effects of SFN associated with anticancer drugs .	[]
