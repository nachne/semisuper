Approximately half of all HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer patients do not respond to trastuzumab-containing therapy .	[]
Therefore , there remains an urgent and unmet clinical need for the development of predictive biomarkers for trastuzumab response .	[]
Recently , several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment is a major contributor to therapy resistance in breast cancer .	[]
In order to explore the predictive value of inflammation in breast cancer patients , we measured the inflammatory biomarkers serum ferritin and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) in 66 patients immediately before undergoing trastuzumab-containing therapy and evaluated their progression-free and overall survival .	[]
The elevation in pre-treatment serum ferritin ( &gt;250 ng/ml ) or CRP ( &gt;7.25 mg/l ) was a significant predictor of reduced progression-free survival and shorter overall survival .	[]
When patients were stratified based on their serum ferritin and CRP levels , patients with elevation in both inflammatory biomarkers had a markedly poorer response to trastuzumab-containing therapy .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Therefore , the elevation in inflammatory serum biomarkers may reflect a pathological state that decreases the clinical efficacy of this therapy .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Anti-inflammatory drugs and life-style changes to decrease inflammation in cancer patients should be explored as possible strategies to sensitize patients to anti-cancer therapeutics .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
