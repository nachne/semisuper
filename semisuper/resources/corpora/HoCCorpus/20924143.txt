Cetuximab is a chimeric antibody registered for the therapy of advanced colorectal carcinoma .	[]
Cancer and anticancer therapy are associated with oxidative stress , and disorders of antioxidant balance may be involved in the toxicity associated with anticancer treatment .	[]
The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes of serum retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein during the first month of treatment with cetuximab and chemotherapy .	[]
Twenty-five consecutive patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma treated with a combination of chemotherapy and cetuximab were included in the present study .	[]
Serum retinol and alpha-tocopherol were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and serum C-reactive protein was determined using commercial kits .	[]
Significant correlation was observed between baseline concentrations of retinol and C-reactive protein ( r(s)=-0.54 , p&lt;0.01 ) .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Median survival of patients who had baseline serum retinol below 1.25 Âµmol/L was 10 mo compared to 18 mo for patients who had serum retinol equal or above 1.25 Âµmol/L ( p&lt;0.05 ) ; median survival of patients who had serum C-reactive protein below 24 mg/L was significantly longer compared to patients with C-reactive protein levels equal or above 24 mg/L ( 18 vs. 7 mo , p&lt;0.05 ) , but no difference in survival was observed based on alpha-tocopherol levels .	[]
Twenty-two patients had evaluation of retinol , alpha-tocopherol and C-reactive protein at least once during the follow up .	[]
Serum concentration of alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the therapy , but retinol and C-reactive protein concentrations remained unchanged .	[]
In conclusion , a significant correlation was observed between serum retinol and C-reactive protein .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Serum alpha-tocopherol decreased significantly during the first month of combination therapy with cetuximab .	[]
Low retinol and high C-reactive protein concentrations were predictive of poor prognosis in this patient population .	[]
