Chronic alcohol ingestion increases hepatic cytochrome P450 2E1 ( CYP2E1 ) , which is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis .	[]
We investigated whether treatment with chlormethiazole ( CMZ ) , a CYP2E1 inhibitor , protects against alcohol-associated hepatic carcinogenesis in rats .	[]
Rats were fed either an ethanol liquid diet or a non-ethanol liquid diet , with or without CMZ for one and ten months .	[]
A single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine ( DEN , 20 mg/kg ) was given to initiate hepatic carcinogenesis .	[]
CYP2E1 expression , inflammatory proteins , cell proliferation , protein-bound 4-HNE , etheno-DNA adducts , 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , retinoid concentrations , and hepatic carcinogenesis were examined .	[]
Ethanol feeding for 1 month with DEN resulted in significantly increased hepatic CYP2E1 levels and increased nuclear accumulation of NF-κB protein and TNF-α expression , which were associated with increased cyclin D1 expression and p-GST positive altered hepatic foci .	[]
All of these changes induced by ethanol feeding were significantly inhibited by the one month CMZ treatment .	[]
At 10-months of treatment , hepatocellular adenomas were detected in ethanol-fed rats only , but neither in control rats nor in animals receiving ethanol and CMZ .	[]
The 8-OHdG formation was found to be significantly increased in ethanol fed animals and normalized with CMZ treatment .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'genomic instability and mutation']
In addition , alcohol-reduced hepatic retinol and retinoic acid concentrations were restored by CMZ treatment to normal levels in the rats at 10 months of treatment .	[]
These data demonstrate that the inhibition of ethanol-induced CYP2E1 as a key pathogenic factor can counteract the tumor-promoting action of ethanol by decreasing TNF-α expression , NF-κB activation , and oxidative DNA damage as well as restoring normal hepatic levels of retinoic acid in DEN-treated rats .
