BACKGROUND Dickkopf-related protein 1 ( DKK1 ) has been reported involved in metastasis and invasion in several tumors .	[]
This study sought to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ICC ) and its role in promoting ICC metastasis .	[]
METHODS Tissue microarrays of 138 ICC patient samples were employed to detect DKK1 , vascular endothelial growth factor C ( VEGF-C ) , and matrix metalloproteinase 9 ( MMP9 ) expression using immunohistochemistry .	[]
The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates .	[]
DKK1 expression was measured in an ICC cell line ( HCCC-9810 ) and ICC tissues by immunofluorescence assay , quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction , and western blot .	[]
Serum levels of DKK1 from 37 ICC patients were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay .	[]
The role of DKK1 in proliferation , migration , invasion , and gene expression regulation was assessed by DKK1 depletion using small interfering RNA .	[]
RESULTS Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor for overall survival and time to recurrence .	[]
The prognostic significance was retained in ICC patients with low recurrence risk ( P &lt ; .05 ) .	[]
DKK1 expression was elevated in an ICC cell line , tumor samples , and patient sera .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
High levels of DKK1 in ICC tissues correlated with elevated MMP9 , VEGF-C , and metastasis of hepatic hilar lymph nodes .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
DKK1 depletion caused a decrease in cell migration and invasiveness , and down-regulation of MMP9 and VEGF-C expression .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS DKK1 is a novel prognostic biomarker for ICC , and it enhances tumor cell invasion and promotes lymph node metastasis of ICC through the induction of MMP9 and VEGF-C .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
DKK1 may be a potential therapeutic target for ICC .	[]
