The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor .	[]
Recent studies have reported the anti-tumor effects of the AhR in breast cancer .	[]
In this study , we investigated the anti-tumor effect of AhR activation based on the cancer stem cell hypothesis .	[]
We show that AhR activation suppressed mammosphere formation of MCF-7 cells and decreased the proportion of cells with high ALDH-1 ( aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 ) activity .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In addition , we also demonstrate that AhR activation regulates self-renewal signaling by down-regulating Wnt/Î²-catenin and Notch .	[]
