The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is essential for cellular proliferation in many cell types , but the molecular link between growth factors and c-Jun activation has been enigmatic .	[]
In this study we identify a previously uncharacterized RING-domain-containing protein , RACO-1 ( RING domain AP-1 co-activator-1 ) , as a c-Jun co-activator that is regulated by growth factor signalling .	[]
RACO-1 interacted with c-Jun independently of amino-terminal phosphorylation , and was both necessary and sufficient for c-Jun/AP-1 activation .	[]
Growth factor-mediated stimulation of AP-1 was attributable to MEK/ERK-dependent stabilization of RACO-1 protein .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Stimulation of the MEK/ERK pathway strongly promoted Lys 63-linked ubiquitylation of RACO-1 , which antagonized Lys 48-linked degradative auto-ubiquitylation of the same Lys residues .	[]
RACO-1 depletion reduced cellular proliferation and decreased expression of several growth-associated AP-1 target genes , such as cdc2 , cyclinD1 and hb-egf .	[]
Moreover , transgenic overexpression of RACO-1 augmented intestinal tumour formation triggered by aberrant Wnt signalling and cooperated with oncogenic Ras in colonic hyperproliferation .	[]
Thus RACO-1 is a co-activator that links c-Jun to growth factor signalling and is essential for AP-1 function in proliferation .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
