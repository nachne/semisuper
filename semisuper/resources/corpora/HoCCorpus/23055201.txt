The epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a fundamental process governing morphogenesis in multicellular organisms and has recently been implicated in promoting carcinoma invasion and metastasis .	[]
Besides their therapeutic effects , accumulating evidences suggest that chemotherapeutic agents also induced EMT and enhanced the malignancy of treated cancer cells ; however , the mechanism(s) still remains unclear .	[]
Here , we investigated the role of Î²-catenin signaling in doxorubicin ( Dox)-induced EMT in human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823 .	[]
We found that the transient treatment of Dox induced EMT and enhanced the in vitro migration ability of cancer cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
We also found that Î²-catenin signaling was activated upon Dox treatment .	[]
Inhibition of Î²-catenin by indomethacin ( Indo ) or siRNA suppressed Dox-induced EMT and decreased cancer cell migration ability .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Our results showed that Î²-catenin signaling was critical to Dox-induced EMT .	[]
Indo and other Î²-catenin inhibitors may have a potential implication in prevention of gastric cancer metastasis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
