The aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication , cell adhesion , migration or proliferation .	[]
In the present study , we investigated the regulation of connexin43 ( Cx43 ) and Cx43-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication ( GJIC ) during the AhR-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells .	[]
The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells , which is frequently abolished in cancer cells ; however , the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood .	[]
Disruption of contact inhibition , which was induced by toxic AhR ligands 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin ( TCDD ) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in epithelial WB-F344 cells , reduced Cx43 protein levels , possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation , significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC , in an AhR-dependent manner .

Although both intracellular and membrane Cx43 pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by TCDD , siRNA-mediated Cx43 knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells .	['evading growth suppressors']
Our data suggest that downregulation of Cx43/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition , which occurs at the post-transcriptional level .	['evading growth suppressors']
This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication , thus suggesting that toxic AhR agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC , two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression .
