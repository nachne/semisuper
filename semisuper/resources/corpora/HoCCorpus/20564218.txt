Proliferation of non-transformed cells is regulated by cell-cell contacts , which are referred to as contact-inhibition .	[]
Vice versa , transformed cells are characterised by a loss of contact-inhibition .	[]
Despite its generally accepted importance for cell-cycle control , little is known about the intracellular signalling pathways involved in contact-inhibition .	[]
Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of contact-inhibition and its loss during tumourigenesis will be an important step towards the identification of novel target genes in tumour diagnosis and treatment .	[]
To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms we identified the transcriptional programme of contact-inhibition in NIH3T3 fibroblast using high-density microarrays .	[]
Setting the cut off : &gt;or=1.5-fold , P &lt;or= 0.05 , 853 genes and 73 cDNA sequences were differentially expressed in confluent compared to exponentially growing cultures .	[]
Importing these data into GenMAPP software revealed a comprehensive list of cell-cycle regulatory genes mediating G0/G1 arrest , which was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot .	[]
In a narrow analysis ( cut off : &gt;or=2-fold , P &lt;or= 0.002 ) , we found 110 transcripts to be differentially expressed representing 107 genes and 3 cDNA sequences involved , for example , in proliferation , signal transduction , transcriptional regulation , cell adhesion and communication .	[]
Interestingly , the majority of genes was upregulated indicating that contact-inhibition is not a passive state , but actively induced .	['evading growth suppressors']
Furthermore , we confirmed differential expression of eight genes by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and identified the potential tumour suppressor transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-beta)-1-induced clone 22 ( TSC-22 ; tgfb1i4 ) as a novel protein to be induced in contact-inhibited cells .
