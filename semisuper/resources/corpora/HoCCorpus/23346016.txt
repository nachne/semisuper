The purpose of the study was to evaluate Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) derived receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition on tumor progression in murine islet cell tumors .	[]
Sorafenib is considered to be a potent inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis and neovascularization in various solid tumors .	[]
Rip1Tag2 mice were treated in two different groups according to the model of tumor progression : the early treatment group received vehicle or Sorafenib from 10 to 14 weeks of age and the late treatment group from week 12 until death .	[]
Tumor surface , tumor cell proliferation , and apoptosis were measured in both treatment groups to assess the in vivo effects of Sorafenib .	[]
Survival was recorded for the late treatment group .	[]
In the early treatment group Sorafenib led to a dramatic decrease in tumor volume compared to the control group .	[]
Apoptosis was significantly augmented and cell proliferation was inhibited .	['resisting cell death', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
As a single therapy Sorafenib significantly improved survival in the late treatment group .	[]
Conclusion .	[]
Sorafenib may provide a new paradigm for the therapy of islet cell tumors .	[]
