OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in cervical squamous carcinoma .	[]
METHODS Eighty cases of invasive cervical squamous cancer were selected as objects of our study .	[]
Double immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 and Ki-67 was used to label the lymphatic vessels and mark the proliferative lymphatic vessels in cervical squamous cancer .	[]
The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and intratumoral lymphatic vessel density was assessed .	[]
The lymphatic vessels proliferation index was evaluated by calculating Ki-67 proliferation index ( PI ) to reflect the lymphangiogenesis of cervical squamous cancer .	[]
Then the correlation between lymphangiogenesis and clinicopathologic features of cervical squamous cancer was analyzed .	[]
RESULTS The LVD of cervical cancer ( 15.23 ï¿½ 3.6 ) was clearly higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 9.9 ï¿½ 2.5 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	[]
The peritumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 18.75 ï¿½ 4.3 ) was significantly higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel density of cervical cancer ( 11.71 ï¿½ 4.9 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Lymphatic PI ( LPI ) of cervical cancer ( 0.258 ï¿½ 0.07 ) was higher than that of the adjacent normal cervical subepithelial tissues ( 0.068 ï¿½ 0.08 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	[]
The peritumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.324 ï¿½ 0.06 ) was notably higher than the intratumoral lymphatic vessel PI of cervical cancer ( 0.232 ï¿½ 0.06 , P &lt ; 0.001 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and peritumoral lymphatic vessel were clearly associated with the lymph node metastasis ( P = 0.001 and P = 0.002 , respectively ) and lymphovascular space invasion ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.01 , respectively ) .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSIONS The high density of peritumoral lymphatic vessels is a potential predictor of more aggressive phenotype of cervical squamous cancer .	[]
