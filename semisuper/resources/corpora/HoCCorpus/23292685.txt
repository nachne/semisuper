Cell invasion is required for neoplastic metastasis .	[]
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( MMP-9 ) , which degrades the extracellular matrix , is a major component in the process of cancer cell invasion .	[]
Sulfuretin is one of the major flavonoids isolated from Rhus verniciflua .	[]
Sulfuretin has been used to reduce oxidative stress , platelet aggregation , the inflammatory response and mutagenesis .	[]
However , the effect of sulfuretin on breast cancer metastasis is unknown .	[]
In this study , we investigated the inhibitory effect of sulfuretin on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate ( TPA)-induced MMP-9 expression and cell invasion in MCF-7 cells .	[]
Sulfuretin inhibited TPA-induced transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-κB ( NF-κB ) .	[]
We demonstrated that sulfuretin mediated the inhibition of TPA-induced MMP-9 expression and that cell invasion in MCF-7 cells involved suppression of the NF-κB pathway .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Therefore , inhibiting MMP-9 expression by sulfuretin may have therapeutic potential for controlling breast cancer invasiveness .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
