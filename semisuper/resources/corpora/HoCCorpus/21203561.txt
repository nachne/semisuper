BACKGROUND NFÎºB signaling is of paramount importance in the regulation of apoptosis , proliferation , and inflammatory responses during human development and homeostasis , as well as in many human cancers .	[]
Receptor Tyrosine Kinases ( RTKs ) , including the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors ( FGFRs ) are also important in development and disease .	[]
However , a direct relationship between growth factor signaling pathways and NFÎºB activation has not been previously described , although FGFs have been known to antagonize TNFÎ±-induced apoptosis .	[]
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Here , we demonstrate an interaction between FGFR4 and IKKÎ² ( Inhibitor of NFÎºB Kinase Î² subunit ) , an essential component in the NFÎºB pathway .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
This novel interaction was identified utilizing a yeast two-hybrid screen [ 1 ] and confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis .	[]
We demonstrate tyrosine phosphorylation of IKKÎ² in the presence of activated FGFR4 , but not kinase-dead FGFR4 .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Following stimulation by TNFÎ± ( Tumor Necrosis Factor Î± ) to activate NFÎºB pathways , FGFR4 activation results in significant inhibition of NFÎºB signaling as measured by decreased nuclear NFÎºB localization , by reduced NFÎºB transcriptional activation in electophoretic mobility shift assays , and by inhibition of IKKÎ² kinase activity towards the substrate GST-IÎºBÎ± in in vitro assays .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
FGF19 stimulation of endogenous FGFR4 in TNFÎ±-treated DU145 prostate cancer cells also leads to a decrease in IKKÎ² activity , concomitant reduction in NFÎºB nuclear localization , and reduced apoptosis .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Microarray analysis demonstrates that FGF19 + TNFÎ± treatment of DU145 cells , in comparison with TNFÎ± alone , favors proliferative genes while downregulating genes involved in apoptotic responses and NFÎºB signaling .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE These results identify a compelling link between FGFR4 signaling and the NFÎºB pathway , and reveal that FGFR4 activation leads to a negative effect on NFÎºB signaling including an inhibitory effect on proapoptotic signaling .	[]
We anticipate that this interaction between an RTK and a component of NFÎºB signaling will not be limited to FGFR4 alone .	[]
