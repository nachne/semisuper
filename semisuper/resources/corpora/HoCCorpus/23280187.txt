The Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway regulates the viability and radiosensitivity of head and neck squamous cancer cells ( HNSCC ) .	[]
Increased Î²-catenin predisposes HNSCC patients to poor prognosis and survival .	[]
This study was conducted to determine the mechanism by which Î²-catenin regulates the viability of HNSCC .	[]
AMC-HN-3 , -HN-8 , UM-SCC-38 , and -SCC-47 cells , which were established from human head and neck cancer specimens , underwent cell death following Î²-catenin silencing. Î²-Catenin silencing significantly induced G1 arrest and increased the expression of Bax and active caspase-3 , which demonstrates the sequential activation of apoptotic cascades following treatment of HNSCC with targeted siRNA .	[]
Intriguingly , Î²-catenin silencing also induced autophagy .	['resisting cell death']
Here , we confirm that the number of autophagic vacuoles and the expression of type II light chain 3 were increased in cells that were treated with Î²-catenin siRNA .	['resisting cell death']
These cell death modes are most likely due to the activation of LKB1-dependent AMPK following Î²-catenin silencing .	[]
The activated LKB1/AMPK pathway in AMC-HN-3 cells caused G1 arrest by phosphorylating p53 and suppressing mTOR signaling .	[]
In addition , treating AMC-HN-3 cells with LKB1 siRNA preserved cell viability against Î²-catenin silencing-induced cytotoxicity .	[]
Taken together , these results imply that following Î²-catenin silencing , HNSCC undergo both apoptotic and autophagic cell death that are under the control of LKB1/AMPK .	['resisting cell death']
To the best of our knowledge , these results suggest for the first time that novel crosstalk between Î²-catenin and the LKB1/AMPK pathway regulates the viability of HNSCC .	[]
This study thus presents new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in Î²-catenin silencing-induced cell death .	['resisting cell death']
