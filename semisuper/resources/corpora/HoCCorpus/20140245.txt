Aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction are common features of aggressive cancer growth .	[]
We observed promoter methylation and loss of expression in neurofilament heavy polypeptide ( NEFH ) in a significant proportion of primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( ESCC ) samples that were of a high tumor grade and advanced stage .	[]
RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NEFH accelerated ESCC cell growth in culture and increased tumorigenicity in vivo , whereas forced expression of NEFH significantly inhibited cell growth and colony formation .	[]
Loss of NEFH caused up-regulation of pyruvate kinase-M2 type and down-regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase , via activation of the Akt/beta-catenin pathway , resulting in enhanced aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction .	['cellular energetics']
The acceleration of glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction in NEFH-knockdown cells was suppressed in the absence of beta-catenin expression , and was decreased by the treatment of 2-Deoxyglucose , a glycolytic inhibitor , or API-2 , an Akt inhibitor .	['cellular energetics']
Loss of NEFH activates the Akt/beta-catenin pathway and increases glycolysis and mitochondrial dysfunction .	['cellular energetics']
Cancer cells with methylated NEFH can be targeted for destruction with specific inhibitors of deregulated downstream pathways .	['cellular energetics']
