Lung cancers express the cholinergic autocrine loop , which facilitates the progression of cancer cells .	[]
The antagonists of mAChRs have been demonstrated to depress the growth of small cell lung cancers ( SCLCs ) .	[]
In this study we intended to investigate the growth inhibitory effect of R2HBJJ , a novel muscarinic antagonist , on non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) cells and the possible mechanisms .	[]
The competitive binding assay revealed that R2HBJJ had a high affinity to M3 and M1 AChRs .	[]
R2HBJJ presented a strong anticholinergic activity on carbachol-induced contraction of guinea-pig trachea .	[]
R2HBJJ markedly suppressed the growth of NSCLC cells , such as H1299 , H460 and H157 .	[]
In H1299 cells , both R2HBJJ and its leading compound R2-PHC displayed significant anti-proliferative activity as M3 receptor antagonist darifenacin .	[]
Exogenous replenish of ACh could attenuate R2HBJJ-induced growth inhibition .	[]
Silencing M3 receptor or ChAT by specific-siRNAs resulted in a growth inhibition of 55.5% and 37.9% on H1299 cells 96 h post transfection , respectively .	[]
Further studies revealed that treatment with R2HBJJ arrested the cell cycle in G0/G1 by down-regulation of cyclin D1-CDK4/6-Rb .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Therefore , the current study reveals that NSCLC cells express an autocrine and paracrine cholinergic system which stimulates the growth of NSCLC cells .	[]
R2HBJJ , as a novel mAChRs antagonist , can block the local cholinergic loop by antagonizing predominantly M3 receptors and inhibit NSCLC cell growth , which suggest that M3 receptor antagonist might be a potential chemotherapeutic regimen for NSCLC .	[]
