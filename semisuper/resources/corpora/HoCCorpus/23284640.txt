The anti-tumor antibiotic salinomycin ( Sal ) was recently identified as a selective inhibitor of breast cancer stem cells ; however , the effect of Sal on hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) is not clear .	[]
This study aimed to determine the anti-tumor efficacy and mechanism of Sal on HCC .	[]
HCC cell lines ( HepG2 , SMMC-7721 , and BEL-7402 ) were treated with Sal .	[]
Cell doubling time was determinated by drawing growth curve , cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit 8 .	[]
The fraction of CD133(+) cell subpopulations was assessed by flow cytometry .	[]
We found that Sal inhibits proliferation and decreases PCNA levels as well as the proportion of HCC CD133(+)cell subpopulations in HCC cells .	[]
Cell cycle was analyzed using flow cytometry and showed that Sal caused cell cycle arrest of the various HCC cell lines in different phases .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Cell apoptosis was evaluated using flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining .	[]
Sal induced apoptosis as characterized by an increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio .	['resisting cell death']
Several signaling pathways were selected for further mechanistic analyses using real time-PCR and Western blot assays .	[]
Compared to control , Î²-catenin expression is significantly down-regulated upon Sal addition .	[]
The Ca(2+) concentration in HCC cells was examined by flow cytometry and higher Ca(2+) concentrations were observed in Sal treatment groups .	[]
The anti-tumor effect of Sal was further verified in vivo using the hepatoma orthotopic tumor model and the data obtained showed that the size of liver tumors in Sal-treated groups decreased compared to controls .	[]
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining also demonstrated that Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vivo .	['resisting cell death']
Finally , the role of Sal on in vivo Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling was evaluated by Western blot and immunohistochemistry .	[]
This study demonstrates Sal inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro and in vivo and one potential mechanism is inhibition of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling via increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels .	['resisting cell death']
