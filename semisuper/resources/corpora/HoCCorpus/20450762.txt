OBJECTIVE To study the clinicopathologic features , immunophenotype and ultrastructural features of sinonasal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors ( IMT ) .	[]
METHODS The clinical and histologic features of 5 cases of sinonasal IMT were reviewed .	[]
Immunohistochemical study for vimentin , MSA , SMA , calponin , h-caldesmon , desmin , ALK , fibronectin , CK , S-100 and Ki-67 was carried out .	[]
Ultrastructural examination was also performed in two of the cases .	[]
RESULTS The patients age ranged from 28 to 62 years ( mean = 43 years ) .	[]
The male-to-female ratio was 2:3 .	[]
The clinical presentation included nasal obstruction , nasal discharge , nasal bleeding , facial pain , facial swelling , toothache and tear overflow .	[]
All of the 5 patients suffered from disease relapses ; and 4 of them had recurrences for more than 5 times .	[]
One patient had lymph node metastasis and 3 patients died of the disease .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Histologically , the tumor cells were arranged in interlacing fascicles and sometimes haphazard in fashion .	[]
They were spindly in shape , cytoplasm eosinophilic with mild nuclear atypia and a low mitotic activity .	[]
The intervening stroma was myxoid in appearance accompanied by lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltration , abundant blood vessels and focal collagenized areas .	[]
In 3 of the recurrent cases , the tumor cells displayed increased nuclear atypia and mitotic activity ( average about 5 to 6 per 10 high-power fields ) , accompanied by patchy necrosis , less inflammatory cell infiltration and focal sarcomatous changes .	['resisting cell death', 'tumor promoting inflammation']
Immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for vimentin .	[]
SMA , MSA , calponin and fibronectin were variably expressed .	[]
Desmin was weakly positive in 1 case .	[]
The staining for h-caldesmon , ALK , S-100 and CK was negative .	[]
The Ki-67 proliferation index increased with tumor recurrences .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Electron microscopy revealed abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and dense body formation in the cytoplasm .	[]
There were an increased amount of collagen fibers in the stroma .	[]
CONCLUSIONS IMT rarely occurs in nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses .	[]
The tumor is prone to local invasion and recurrences , with subsequent progression to frank malignancy and distant metastasis , resulting in high mortality and poor prognosis .	[]
Complete surgical resection remains the main modality of treatment .	[]
