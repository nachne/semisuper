Oxidative stress is the main etiological factor behind the pathogenesis of various diseases including inflammation , cancer , cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders .	[]
Due to the spin trapping abilities and various pharmacological properties of nitrones , their application as therapeutic agent has been gaining attention .	[]
Though the antioxidant properties of the nitrones are well known , the mechanism by which they modulate the cellular defense machinery against oxidative stress is not well investigated and requires further elucidation .	[]
Here , we have investigated the mechanisms of cytoprotection of the nitrone spin traps against oxidative stress in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) .	[]
Cytoprotective properties of both the cyclic nitrone 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide ( DMPO ) and linear nitrone Î±-phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone ( PBN ) against HâOâ-induced cytotoxicity were investigated .	[]
Preincubation of BAEC with PBN or DMPO resulted in the inhibition of HâOâ-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis .	['resisting cell death']
Nitrone-treatment resulted in the induction and restoration of phase II antioxidant enzymes via nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 ( Nrf-2 ) in oxidatively-challenged cells .	[]
Furthermore , the nitrones were found to inhibit the mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent activation of caspase-3 induced by HâOâ .	[]
Significant down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic proteins p53 and Bax , and up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and p-Bad were observed when the cells were preincubated with the nitrones prior to HâOâ-treatment .	[]
It was also observed that Nrf-2 silencing completely abolished the protective effects of nitrones .	[]
Hence , these findings suggest that nitrones confer protection to the endothelial cells against oxidative stress by modulating phase II antioxidant enzymes and subsequently inhibiting mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cascade .	[]
