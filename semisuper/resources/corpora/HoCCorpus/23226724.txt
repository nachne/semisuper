Metastasis , commonly to the lung , is the major cause of mortality from testicular cancer .	[]
The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of a novel nutrient mixture ( NM ) containing ascorbic acid , amino acids and green tea extract on the inhibition of melanoma growth and metastasis using a model of intratesticular inoculation of B16FO cells into nude mice .	[]
Male athymic mice ( n=12 ) , 10-12 weeks of age , were inoculated with 5ï¿½10(5) B16FO melanoma cells in 100 Î¼l of PBS into the right testis , while the left testis was left untreated .	[]
Following inoculation , the mice were randomly divided into two groups .	[]
The control group ( n=6 ) was fed a regular mouse chow diet and the NM 1% group ( n=6 ) the same diet , but supplemented with 1% NM .	[]
Four weeks later the mice were sacrificed and the abdominal cavity was opened .	[]
Mice in the control group exhibited extensive metastasis in the peritoneal cavity and severely enlarged right testes and necrotic seminiferous tubules .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
By contrast , in the NM 1% fed group there was no evidence of peritoneal metastasis in 50% of the animals and mild metastasis in the remaining 50% .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
The right testes were enlarged and seminiferous tubules in the area of invasion showed evidence of degeneration .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
No metastasis to the liver , kidney or spleen were evident in either group .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
However , severe lung metastasis was observed in 2 of 6 mice in the control group and mild metastasis in 2 of 6 mice in the NM 1% group .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
In conclusion , these results confirm earlier studies and verify the anti-metastatic potential of NM .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
