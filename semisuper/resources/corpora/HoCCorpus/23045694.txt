Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) are considered to be the cell of origin of glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) .	[]
However , the genetic alterations that transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells remain elusive .	[]
Using a unique transposon mutagenesis strategy that mutagenizes NSCs in culture , followed by additional rounds of mutagenesis to generate tumors in vivo , we have identified genes and signaling pathways that can transform NSCs into glioma-initiating cells .	[]
Mobilization of Sleeping Beauty transposons in NSCs induced the immortalization of astroglial-like cells , which were then able to generate tumors with characteristics of the mesenchymal subtype of GBM on transplantation , consistent with a potential astroglial origin for mesenchymal GBM .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Sequence analysis of transposon insertion sites from tumors and immortalized cells identified more than 200 frequently mutated genes , including human GBM-associated genes , such as Met and Nf1 , and made it possible to discriminate between genes that function during astroglial immortalization vs. later stages of tumor development .	['enabling replicative immortality', 'genomic instability and mutation']
We also functionally validated five GBM candidate genes using a previously undescribed high-throughput method .	[]
Finally , we show that even clonally related tumors derived from the same immortalized line have acquired distinct combinations of genetic alterations during tumor development , suggesting that tumor formation in this model system involves competition among genetically variant cells , which is similar to the Darwinian evolutionary processes now thought to generate many human cancers .	[]
This mutagenesis strategy is faster and simpler than conventional transposon screens and can potentially be applied to any tissue stem/progenitor cells that can be grown and differentiated in vitro .	['genomic instability and mutation']
