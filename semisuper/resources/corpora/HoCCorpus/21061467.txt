Cell division and apoptosis are two crucial components of tumor biology and the importance of increased cell proliferation and reduced cell death have made them valid therapeutic targets .	[]
The plant kingdom is a relatively underexploited cache of novel drugs , and crude extracts of plants are known for their synergistic activity .	[]
The present study assessed the anti-proliferative activity of the medicinal plant Centrosema pubescens Benth .	[]
Centrosema pubescens dichloromethane extract ( CPDE ) inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 ( promyelocytic acute leukaemia ) cells with an ICââ value of 5 Î¼g/ml .	[]
Further studies also showed that CPDE induces growth arrest at the G1 phase and specifically down-regulates the expressions of cyclin E and CDK2 and up-regulates p27(CKI) levels .	['evading growth suppressors']
These events apparently lead to the induction of apoptosis , which was demonstrated qualitatively by a DNA fragmentation assay and propidium iodide staining .	['resisting cell death']
Quantitative assessment of the effective arrest of the cell cycle and of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry .	[]
CPDE exhibited negligible cytotoxicity even at the highest dose tested ( 100 Î¼g/ml ) in both normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in an in vitro model ( HL-60 ) .	[]
Our results strongly suggest that CPDE arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase and triggers apoptosis by caspase activation .	[]
