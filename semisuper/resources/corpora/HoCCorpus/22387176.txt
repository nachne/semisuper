Partial or whole-brain irradiation is often required to treat both primary and metastatic brain cancer .	[]
Radiation-induced normal tissue injury , including progressive cognitive impairment , however , can significantly affect the well-being of the approximately 200,000 patients who receive these treatments each year in the United States .	[]
Although the exact mechanisms underlying radiation-induced late effects remain unclear , oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to play a critical role .	[]
Microglia are key mediators of neuroinflammation .	[]
Peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor ( PPAR ) Î´ has been shown to be a potent regulator of anti-inflammatory responses .	[]
Thus , we hypothesized that PPARÎ´ activation would modulate the radiation-induced inflammatory response in microglia .	[]
Incubating BV-2 murine microglial cells with the PPARÎ´ agonist L-165041 prevented the radiation-induced increase in : ( i ) intracellular reactive oxygen species generation , ( ii ) Cox-2 and MCP-1 expression , and ( iii ) IL-1Î² and TNF-Î± message levels .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
This occurred , in part , through PPARÎ´-mediated modulation of stress-activated kinases and proinflammatory transcription factors .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
PPARÎ´ inhibited NF-ÎºB via transrepression by physically interacting with the p65 subunit and prevented activation of the PKCÎ±/MEK1/2/ERK1/2/AP-1 pathway by inhibiting the radiation-induced increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
These data support the hypothesis that PPARÎ´ activation can modulate radiation-induced oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in microglia .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
