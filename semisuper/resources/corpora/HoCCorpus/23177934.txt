Metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells provides energy and multiple intermediates critical for cell growth .	[]
Hypoxia in tumors represents a hostile environment that can encourage these transformations .	[]
We report that glycogen metabolism is upregulated in tumors invivo and in cancer cells invitro in response to hypoxia .	[]
Invitro , hypoxia induced an early accumulation of glycogen , followed bya gradual decline .	[]
Concordantly , glycogen synthase ( GYS1 ) showed a rapid induction , followed by a later increase of glycogen phosphorylase ( PYGL ) .	[]
PYGL depletion and the consequent glycogen accumulation led to increased reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) levels that contributed to a p53-dependent induction of senescence and markedly impaired tumorigenesis invivo .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'enabling replicative immortality']
Metabolic analyses indicated that glycogen degradation by PYGL is important for the optimal function of the pentose phosphate pathway .	[]
Thus , glycogen metabolism is a key pathway induced by hypoxia , necessary for optimal glucose utilization , which represents a targetable mechanism of metabolic adaptation .	[]
