BACKGROUND: : Radiotherapy is an efficient remedy in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( Hca ) ; however , some cancer cells can still survive from the radiation and the therapeutic effect is to be improved .	[]
Regulatory T cell ( Tregs)-induced tumor tolerance and Akt expression play important roles in the tumor survival .	[]
This study aims to elucidate the role of radiation induces Akt expression in Tregs .	[]
METHODS: : A rat Hca model was developed .	[]
Hca tissue was collected from the rats with or without radiotherapy .	[]
The frequency of Treg and apoptotic Treg in Hca tissue was assessed by flow cytometry .	[]
A cell culture model was used to investigate the mechanism by which the tumor-infiltrating Tregs survive from irradiation .	[]
RESULTS: : After radiotherapy , the frequency of Treg was increased in Hca , the frequency of apoptotic Tregs was decreased and the expression of Akt was increased in the remaining Tregs .	['resisting cell death']
The results were reproduced in vitro with a cell culture model .	[]
The addition of Akt inhibitor blocked the irradiation-induced Treg survival .	[]
Tregs with high levels of Akt still preserve the immune suppressor function .	['avoiding immune destruction']
CONCLUSIONS: : Akt plays an important role in the radiation-induced tumor-infiltrating Treg survival in Hca .	[]
