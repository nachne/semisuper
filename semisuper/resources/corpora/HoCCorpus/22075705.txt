Endothelin plays important roles in various physiological functions including vascular constriction .	[]
Recent studies reported that the endothelin receptors ETA and ETB are highly expressed in lung and skin tumor tissues .	[]
In contrast , there are few reports on endothelin signalling in the proliferation of head and neck cancer .	[]
We found that both ETA and ETB endothelin receptors were overexpressed in tumor cells of tongue cancer samples by immunohistochemistry .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
ETA and ETB were expressed in cultured lingual and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCs ) cell lines .	[]
When both cultured cell lines were treated with an ETA selective antagonist ( BQ123 ) or an ETB selective antagonist ( BQ788 ) , inhibition of cell growth was observed .	[]
Similar results were observed when SCCs were treated with specific siRNA for the suppression of ETA or ETB .	[]
Furthermore , inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway by the treatments with ET receptor antagonists and siRNA was also observed .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These results indicate that endothelin signalling may , in part , play important roles in cell growth in SCCs through the MAP kinase pathway .	[]
