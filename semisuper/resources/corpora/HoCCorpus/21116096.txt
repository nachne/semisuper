A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DNA repair after exposure to ionizing radiation represents a research priority aimed at improving the outcome of clinical radiotherapy .	[]
Because of the close association with DNA double strand break ( DSB ) repair , phosphorylation of the histone H2AX protein ( Î³H2AX ) , quantified by immunodetection , has recently been used as a method to study DSB induction and repair at low and clinically relevant radiation doses .	[]
However , the lack of consistency in literature points to the need to further validate the role of H2AX phosphorylation in DSB repair and the use of this technique to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity .	[]
In the present study we used human mammary epithelial MCF10A cells , characterized by a radiosensitive phenotype due to reduced levels of the Ku70 and Ku80 repair proteins , and investigated whether this repair-deficient cell line displays differences in the phosphorylation pattern of H2AX protein compared to repair-proficient MCF10A cells .	['genomic instability and mutation']
This was established by measuring formation and disappearance of Î³H2AX foci after irradiating synchronized cell populations with ( 60)Co Î³-rays .	[]
Our results show statistically significant differences in the number of Î³H2AX foci between the repair-deficient and -proficient cell line , with a higher amount of Î³H2AX foci present at early times post-irradiation in the Ku-deficient cell line .	['genomic instability and mutation']
However , the disappearance of those differences at later post-irradiation times questions the use of this assay to determine intrinsic radiosensitivity , especially in a clinical setting .	[]
