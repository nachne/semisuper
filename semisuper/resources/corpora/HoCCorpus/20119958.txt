We investigated the mechanisms of DNA exit during single-cell gel electrophoresis ( the comet assay ) by measuring the kinetics of the comet tail formation .	[]
In the neutral comet assay , the rate of DNA exit was found to be dependent on the topological state of DNA , which was influenced by either ethidium bromide or a low radiation dose .	[]
The results clearly show that the comet tail is formed by extended DNA loops : the loop extension , being reversible when the DNA torsional constraint remains in the loops , is favored when the constraint is relaxed .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The kinetics of the comet formation in the case of a high radiation dose points out that accumulation of the single-strand breaks causes DNA fragmentation .	['genomic instability and mutation']
In contrast to the neutral comet assay , the alkaline comet assay is not related to the chromatin loops .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Our results imply that the alkaline treatment induces detachment of the loops from the nuclear matrix , and the comet tail is formed by ssDNA fragments , the ends of which are pulled out from the comet head by electric force .	['genomic instability and mutation']
We suggest that the kinetic approach can be considered as an important improvement of the comet assay .	['genomic instability and mutation']
