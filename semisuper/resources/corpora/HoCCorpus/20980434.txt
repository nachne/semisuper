p38 kinases activated by growth factors , hormones , and environmental stresses exert diverse functions in regulating normal and malignant cell pathophysiology .	[]
Enhanced levels of activated p38 isoforms have been linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer , although the mechanistic basis for this association is poorly understood .	[]
In this study , we report that p38 activation in cervical cancer cells is driven by osteopontin ( OPN ) , an extracellular matrix-associated cytokine that drives invasive progression .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
OPN regulates CD44-mediated p38 phosphorylation that induces NF-ÎºB activation and NF-ÎºB-dependent expression of furin , an extracellular protease implicated in human papilloma virus ( HPV ) processing that enhances cervical cancer cell motility .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
OPN induces CD44-mediated MKK3/6 phosphorylation which in turn phosphorylates p38 in these cells .	[]
OPN-induced furin expression and cell motility was impeded by blockades to MKK3/6 , p38Î±/Î² or NF-ÎºB signaling .	[]
In a mouse xenograft model of human cervical cancer , tumor growth was enhanced by OPN overexpression and blocked by short hairpin RNA ( shRNA)-mediated OPN silencing .	[]
Furin overexpression similarly augmented tumor growth in the model , whereas blocking MKK3/6 , p38 , or furin reduced OPN-induced cervical tumor growth .	[]
Analysis of clinical specimens revealed that enhanced expression of OPN , phosphorylated NF-ÎºB , p65 , and furin correlated with cervical cancer progression , further strengthening the in vitro and in vivo results .	[]
In summary , our findings offer a proof of concept for targeting OPN and its downstream p38 signaling as a novel therapeutic strategy to manage cervical cancer .	[]
