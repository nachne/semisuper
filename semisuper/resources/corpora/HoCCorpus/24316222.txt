Hypoxia has long been linked to the Warburg effect , yet the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear .	[]
It is also not known if lncRNAs are involved in the contribution of hypoxia to the Warburg effect .	[]
Here we show that lincRNA-p21 is a hypoxia-responsive lncRNA and is essential for hypoxia-enhanced glycolysis .	['cellular energetics']
Hypoxia/HIF-1α-induced lincRNA-p21 is able to bind HIF-1α and VHL and thus disrupts the VHL-HIF-1α interaction .	[]
This disassociation attenuates VHL-mediated HIF-1α ubiquitination and causes HIF-1α accumulation .	[]
These data indicate the existence of a positive feedback loop between HIF-1α and lincRNA-p21 that promotes glycolysis under hypoxia .	['cellular energetics']
The ability of lincRNA-p21 to promote tumor growth is validated in mouse xenograft models .	[]
Together , these findings suggest that lincRNA-p21 is an important player in the regulation of the Warburg effect and also implicate lincRNA-p21 as a valuable therapeutic target for cancer .	['cellular energetics']
