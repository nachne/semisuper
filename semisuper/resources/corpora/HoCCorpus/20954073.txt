Ceramide induces cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death associated with increased levels of p27(kip1) .	[]
The aim of this study was to examine the effects of ceramide on p27(kip1) protein levels as a measure of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	[]
Results showed that ceramide increased p27(kip1) protein levels through activation of protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Treatment of cells with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or with PP2A-CÎ± siRNA inhibited ceramide-induced enhanced p27(kip1) protein expression and Akt dephosphorylation , and prevented Skp2 downregulation .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Overexpression of constitutively active Akt attenuated ceramide-induced Skp2 downregulation and p27(kip1) upregulation .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
In addition , ceramide stimulated binding of the PP2A catalytic subunit PP2A-CÎ±Î² to Akt as assessed by immunoprecipitation experiments , indicating that PP2A is involved in the induction of p27(kip1) via inhibition of Akt pathway .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Finally , whether PP2A can regulate p27(kip1) expression independently of Akt pathway was determined .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Knockdown of PP2A-CÎ± with siRNA reduced p27(kip1) levels in the presence of Akt inhibitor .	['evading growth suppressors']
These data reveal that PP2A is a regulator of ceramide-induced p27(kip1) expression via Akt-dependent and Akt-independent pathways .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
