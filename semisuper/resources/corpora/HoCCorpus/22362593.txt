Clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ) is the most common pathological subtype of kidney cancer .	[]
Here , we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease .	[]
One of the most potent survival regulators , the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 ( SLC16A3 ) , impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets .	[]
MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .	['resisting cell death', 'cellular energetics']
Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis , and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines .	['cellular energetics']
Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs .	[]
MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival , whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade .	[]
Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression , MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC .	['cellular energetics']
