Sarcomatoid renal cell carcinomas of the kidney are rare neoplasms constituting about 1-5% of all renal malignant neoplasms .	[]
These are aggressive tumors and are commonly associated with conventional ( clear cell ) renal cell carcinomas , but cases associated with chromophobe renal cell carcinomas are sparse .	[]
Cytological features of such lesions have rarely been reported .	[]
Here , we report a unique case of a 48-year-old male patient who presented with right flank lump and pain .	[]
A fine needle aspiration was performed from the lesion under ultrasound guidance and a cytological diagnosis of pleomorphic sarcoma was made .	[]
A right-sided radical nephrectomy was carried out and subsequent histopathology revealed a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma with wide areas of necrosis coexisting with chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with calcification .	['resisting cell death']
Differentiation of pleomorphic sarcoma from a sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma is , thus , challenging from cytopathology smears and the differential diagnoses should always be borne in mind while giving a cytopathological opinion .	[]
