BACKGROUND Astaxanthin modulates immune response , inhibits cancer cell growth , reduces bacterial load and gastric inflammation , and protects against UVA-induced oxidative stress in in vitro and rodent models .	[]
Similar clinical studies in humans are unavailable .	[]
Our objective is to study the action of dietary astaxanthin in modulating immune response , oxidative status and inflammation in young healthy adult female human subjects .	[]
METHODS Participants ( averaged 21.5 yr ) received 0 , 2 , or 8 mg astaxanthin ( n = 14/diet ) daily for 8 wk in a randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study .	[]
Immune response was assessed on wk 0 , 4 and 8 , and tuberculin test performed on wk 8 .	[]
RESULTS Plasma astaxanthin increased ( P &lt ; 0.01 ) dose-dependently after 4 or 8 wk of supplementation .	[]
Astaxanthin decreased a DNA damage biomarker after 4 wk but did not affect lipid peroxidation .	['genomic instability and mutation']
Plasma C-reactive protein concentration was lower ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) on wk 8 in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin .	['tumor promoting inflammation']
Dietary astaxanthin stimulated mitogen-induced lymphoproliferation , increased natural killer cell cytotoxic activity , and increased total T and B cell subpopulations , but did not influence populations of Thelper , Tcytotoxic or natural killer cells .	[]
A higher percentage of leukocytes expressed the LFA-1 marker in subjects given 2 mg astaxanthin on wk 8 .	[]
Subjects fed 2 mg astaxanthin had a higher tuberculin response than unsupplemented subjects .	[]
There was no difference in TNF and IL-2 concentrations , but plasma IFN-gamma and IL-6 increased on wk 8 in subjects given 8 mg astaxanthin .	[]
CONCLUSION Therefore , dietary astaxanthin decreases a DNA damage biomarker and acute phase protein , and enhances immune response in young healthy females .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'genomic instability and mutation']
