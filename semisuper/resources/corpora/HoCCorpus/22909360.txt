BACKGROUND Although basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) is the most common type of skin cancer , the incidence of metastasis is exceedingly low .	[]
OBJECTIVE Case presentation of a basal cell carcinoma arising on the dorsum of the foot with inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastases .	[]
METHOD Case presentation with literature review .	[]
RESULT On the basis of our review of Japanese literature , the risk factors for BCC metastasis are occurrence on the genitalia , diameter of more than 3 cm , deep invasion of tumor cells into extradermal structures , and infiltrative/morpheic histological type .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
CONCLUSION Although metastasis from BCC is extremely rare , the prognosis of metastatic BCC is often poor .	[]
Careful follow-up is recommended in cases with high risk factors .	[]
