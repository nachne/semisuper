Methyleugenol ( MEG ) , a constituent of plants used in the human diet , is hepatocarcinogenic in rodents .	[]
In an experiment to elucidate its mode of action in rat liver , male F344 rats were administered MEG intragastrically at 3 doses per week for up to 16 weeks in an initiation phase , after which half the rats were fed 500 ppm phenobarbital ( PB ) in the diet to promote liver neoplasia and the other half were maintained on control diet for 24 weeks .	[]
At 8 and 16 week interim terminations , ( 32)P-nucleotide postlabeling assay revealed 3 adducts in livers of all MEG groups .	['genomic instability and mutation']
The hepatocellular replicating fractions , measured by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunohistochemistry , were doubled or more in all MEG groups .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
Hepatocellular altered foci , detected by glutathione S-transferase-placental type ( Ï€ ) immunohistochemistry , were present beginning with the high dose group at 8 weeks and extending to all MEG groups at 16 weeks .	[]
At the end of maintenance/promotion phase , the incidences , multiplicity and size of foci was similar between control and low dose groups , while those of mid and high dose groups were increased .	[]
Hepatocellular adenomas occurred in the mid and high dose groups , attaining higher multiplicity and size with PB .	[]
Thus , MEG had rapid initiating activity , reflecting the formation of DNA adducts and possibly cell proliferation .	['genomic instability and mutation']
