OBJECTIVE To evaluate the Expression and correlation of cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF ) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma .	[]
METHOD In this study , expression levels of COX-2 , VEGF were examined in 58 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 38 patients with inflammation in nasopharyngeal mucosa by immunohistochemistry method .	[]
RESULT The expression of COX-2 , VEGF were higher in nasopharyngeal carcinoma than those in nasopharyngeal mucosa ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) , and they had some correlation with the invasion and lymphatic metastasis and with the clinical stage of nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'tumor promoting inflammation', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
The expression of COX-2 was positively correlated with that of VEGF ( P &lt ; 0.05 ) .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
CONCLUSION The coexpression of COX-2 and VEGF may play animportant role in the carcinogenesis and development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma , and they may prom ( see text ) lymph node metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'tumor promoting inflammation', 'activating invasion and metastasis']
