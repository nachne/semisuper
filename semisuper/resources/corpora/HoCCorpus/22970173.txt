Cellular senescence can be a functional barrier to carcinogenesis .	[]
We hypothesized that inflammation modulates carcinogenesis through senescence and DNA damage response ( DDR ) .	[]
We examined the association between senescence and DDR with macrophage levels in inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) .	[]
In vitro experiments tested the ability of macrophages to induce senescence in primary cells .	['enabling replicative immortality']
Inflammation modulating microRNAs were identified in senescence colon tissue for further investigation .	['enabling replicative immortality']
