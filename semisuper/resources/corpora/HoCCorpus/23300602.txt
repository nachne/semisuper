Activation of p53 effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis that is necessary for tumor growth and metastasis .	[]
Reactivation of the p53 by small molecules has emerged as a promising new strategy for cancer therapy .	[]
Several classes of small-molecules that activate the p53 pathway have been discovered using various approaches .	[]
Here , we identified harmine ( Î²-carboline alkaloid ) as a novel activator of p53 signaling involved in inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth .	[]
Harmine induced p53 phosphorylation and disrupted the p53-MDM2 interaction .	[]
Harmine also prevented p53 degradation in the presence of cycloheximide and activated nuclear accumulation of p53 followed by increasing its transcriptional activity in endothelial cells .	[]
Moreover , harmine not only induced endothelial cell cycle arrest and apoptosis , but also suppressed endothelial cell migration and tube formation as well as induction of neovascularity in a mouse corneal micropocket assay .	['inducing angiogenesis', 'resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
Finally , harmine inhibited tumor growth by reducing tumor angiogenesis , as demonstrated by a xenograft tumor model .	['inducing angiogenesis']
Our results suggested a novel mechanism and bioactivity of harmine , which inhibited tumor growth by activating the p53 signaling pathway and blocking angiogenesis in endothelial cells .	['inducing angiogenesis']
