In lung cancer , platelet-derived growth factor receptor Î± ( PDGFRÎ± ) is expressed frequently by tumor-associated stromal cells and by cancer cells in a subset of tumors .	[]
We sought to determine the effect of targeting stromal PDGFRÎ± in preclinical lung tumor xenograft models ( human tumor , mouse stroma ) .	[]
Effects of anti-human ( IMC-3G3 ) and anti-mouse ( 1E10 ) PDGFRÎ± monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) on proliferation and PDGFRÎ± signaling were evaluated in lung cancer cell lines and mouse fibroblasts .	[]
Therapy studies were conducted using established PDGFRÎ±-positive H1703 cells and PDGFRÎ±-negative Calu-6 , H1993 , and A549 subcutaneous tumors in immunocompromised mice treated with vehicle , anti-PDGFRÎ± mAbs , chemotherapy , or combination therapy .	[]
Tumors were analyzed for growth and levels of growth factors .	[]
IMC-3G3 inhibited PDGFRÎ± activation and the growth of H1703 cells in vitro and tumor growth in vivo , but had no effect on PDGFRÎ±-negative cell lines or mouse fibroblasts. 1E10 inhibited growth and PDGFRÎ± activation of mouse fibroblasts , but had no effect on human cancer cell lines in vitro .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
In vivo , 1E10-targeted inhibition of murine PDGFRÎ± reduced tumor growth as single-agent therapy in Calu-6 cells and enhanced the effect of chemotherapy in xenografts derived from A549 cells .	[]
We also identified that low expression cancer cell expression of VEGF-A and elevated expression of PDGF-AA were associated with response to stromal PDGFRÎ± targeting .	[]
We conclude that stromal PDGFRÎ± inhibition represents a means for enhancing control of lung cancer growth in some cases , independent of tumor cell PDGFRÎ± expression .	[]
