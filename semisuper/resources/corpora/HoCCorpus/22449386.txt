The submandibular gland-derived tumor cell line SCA-9 is considered a useful tool to study the signaling pathways involved in proliferation , and their regulation , triggered by different stimuli .	[]
It is proposed that the non neuronal cholinergic system : acethylcholine , the enzymes that synthesize and degrade it , and the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors , play a key role in tumorigenesis .	[]
Here , we investigate the role of muscarinic receptors in SCA-9 cell proliferation , and the modulation of cholinergic signaling pathways exerted by the nuclear transcription factor ÎºB ( NF-ÎºB ) .	[]
The activation of cholinergic receptors by carbachol ( 10â»â¹M ) increased cell proliferation ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
This was prevented by preincubating cells with the muscarinic antagonist atropine but not by mecamylamine , a nicotinic receptor blocker .	[]
Phospholipase C ( PLC)/nitric oxide synthase ( NOS)/arginase pathway is involved in this effect , since carbachol stimulated nitric oxide production , increased NOS2 and NOS3 expressions , urea production , and arginase II expression ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	[]
Also , phospholipase Aâ ( PLAâ)/cyclooxygenase ( COX ) pathway is up-regulated in carbachol-induced SCA-9 cell proliferation , because prostaglandin Eâ liberation ( P&lt;0.001 ) is increased and COX-1 expression is turned up ( P&lt;0.001 ) .	[]
Interactions between PLC/NOS/arginases and PLAâ/COX pathways via its metabolites were detected .	[]
SCA-9 cells exhibit a constitutive activation of NF-ÎºB , which regulates carbachol-induced NOS2 and 3 , arginase II and COX-1 expressions .	[]
In addition , protein kinase C is involved in the up-regulation of NOS2 and arginase II enzymes induced by carbachol via NF-ÎºB .	[]
In conclusion , the activation of cholinergic receptors in SCA-9 tumor cells promotes proliferation via muscarinic effector enzymes , and reveals the participation of NF-ÎºB at this step of tumorigenesis .	[]
