Cancer cells convert glucose preferentially to lactate even in the presence of oxygen ( aerobic glycolysis-Warburg effect ) .	[]
New concepts in cancer treatment aim at inhibition of aerobic glycolysis .	[]
Pyruvate dehydrogenase converts pyruvate to acetylCoA thus preventing lactate formation .	[]
Therefore , the aim of this study was to evaluate compounds that could activate pyruvate dehydrogenase in cancer cells .	[]
We investigated the effects of ( R)-(+)-Î±-lipoic acid ( LPA ) and dichloroacetate ( DCA ) , possible activators of pyruvate dehydrogenase , on suppression of aerobic glycolysis and induction of cell death .	[]
The neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly , SK-N-SH , Neuro-2a and the breast cancer cell line SkBr3 were incubated with different concentrations ( 0.1-30 mM ) of LPA and DCA .	[]
The effects of both compounds on cell viability/proliferation ( WST-1 assay ) , [ 18F]-FDG uptake , lactate production and induction of apoptosis ( flow cytometric detection of caspase-3 ) were evaluated .	[]
Furthermore , NMRI nu/nu mice that had been inoculated s.c. with SkBr3 cells were treated daily for four weeks with LPA ( i.p , 18.5 mg/kg ) starting at day 7 p.i. .	[]
Tumor development was measured with a sliding calliper and monitored via [ 18F]-FDG-PET .	[]
Residual tumors after therapy were examined histopathologically .	[]
These data suggests that LPA can reduce ( 1 ) cell viability/proliferation , ( 2 ) uptake of [ 18F]-FDG and ( 3 ) lactate production and increase apoptosis in all investigated cell lines .	['resisting cell death', 'cellular energetics']
In contrast , DCA was almost ineffective .	[]
In the mouse xenograft model with s.c .	[]
SkBr3 cells , daily treatment with LPA retarded tumor progression .	[]
Therefore , LPA seems to be a promising compound for cancer treatment .	[]
