Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Western countries .	[]
A significant number of CRC patients undergoing curatively intended surgery subsequently develop recurrence and die from the disease .	[]
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are aberrantly expressed in cancers and appear to have both diagnostic and prognostic significance .	[]
In this study , we identified novel miRNAs associated with recurrence of CRC , and their possible mechanism of action .	[]
TaqManï¿½ Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosas and 46 microsatellite stable CRC tumors .	[]
Four miRNAs ( miR-362-3p , miR-570 , miR-148a* and miR-944 ) were expressed at a higher level in tumors from patients with no recurrence ( p &lt ; 0.015 ) , compared to tumors from patients with recurrence .	[]
A significant association with increased disease free survival was confirmed for miR-362-3p in a second independent cohort of 43 CRC patients , using single TaqManï¿½ microRNA assays .	[]
In vitro functional analysis showed that over-expression of miR-362-3p in colon cancer cell lines reduced cell viability , and proliferation mainly due to cell cycle arrest .	['evading growth suppressors', 'sustaining proliferative signaling']
E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1 were identified as potential miR-362-3p targets by mRNA profiling of HCT116 cells over-expressing miR-362-3p .	[]
Subsequently , these genes were confirmed as direct targets by Luciferase reporter assays .	[]
Their knockdown in vitro phenocopied the effects of miR-362-3p over-expression .	[]
We conclude that miR-362-3p may be a novel prognostic marker in CRC , and hypothesize that the positive effects of augmented miR-362-3p expression may in part be mediated through the targets E2F1 , USF2 and PTPN1. ï¿½ 2012 Wiley Periodicals , Inc .	[]
