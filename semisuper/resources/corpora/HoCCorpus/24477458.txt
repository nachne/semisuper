Aberrant glucose metabolism characterized by high levels of glycolysis , even in the presence of oxygen , is an important hallmark of cancer .	[]
This metabolic reprogramming referred to as the Warburg effect is essential to the survival of tumor cells and provides them with substrates required for biomass generation .	[]
Molecular mechanisms responsible for this shift in glucose metabolism remain elusive .	[]
As described herein , we found that aberrant expression of the proinflammatory protein transglutaminase 2 ( TG2 ) is an important regulator of the Warburg effect in mammary epithelial cells .	['tumor promoting inflammation', 'cellular energetics']
Mechanistically , TG2 regulated metabolic reprogramming by constitutively activating nuclear factor ( NF)-κB , which binds to the hypoxia-inducible factor ( HIF)-1α promoter and induces its expression even under normoxic conditions .	[]
TG2/NF-κB-induced increase in HIF-1α expression was associated with increased glucose uptake , increased lactate production and decreased oxygen consumption by mitochondria .	[]
Experimental suppression of TG2 attenuated HIF-1α expression and reversed downstream events in mammary epithelial cells .	[]
Moreover , downregulation of p65/RelA or HIF-1α expression in these cells restored normal glucose uptake , lactate production , mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic protein expression .	['cellular energetics']
Our results suggest that aberrant expression of TG2 is a master regulator of metabolic reprogramming and facilitates metabolic alterations in epithelial cells even under normoxic conditions .	[]
A TG2-induced shift in glucose metabolism helps breast cancer cells to survive under stressful conditions and promotes their metastatic competence .	['activating invasion and metastasis', 'cellular energetics']
