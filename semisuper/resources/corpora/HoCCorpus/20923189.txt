The aim of this study was to determine whether isorhamnetin , an immediate 3'-O-methylated metabolite of quercetin , affects proliferation , cell death , and the cell cycle of human colon carcinoma ( HCT-116 ) cells .	[]
Isorhamnetin was found to be a potent antiproliferative agent in a dose- and time-dependent manner , with an IC50 of 72 Î¼M after 48 h of incubation as estimated by MTT assay .	[]
Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that isorhamnetin exerted a stimulatory effect on apoptosis and necrosis .	['resisting cell death']
Isorhamnetin also increased the number of cells in G2/M phase .	['evading growth suppressors']
Serum deprivation appeared to potentiate the effects of isorhamnetin on cell death and facilitated cell cycle progression to G0/G1 phase .	['sustaining proliferative signaling']
These results suggest that isorhamnetin might mediate inhibition of HCT-116 cell growth through the perturbation of cell cycle progression and are consistent with the notion that G2/M checkpoints could be a conserved target for flavonoids in human colon cancer cells , leading to apoptotic and necrotic death .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors']
These antiproliferative , apoptotic , necrotic , and cell cycle effects suggest that isorhamnetin may have clinically significant therapeutic and chemopreventive capabilities .	['resisting cell death', 'evading growth suppressors']
To our knowledge , this is the first report of the effect of isorhamnetin on human colon cancer cells .	[]
