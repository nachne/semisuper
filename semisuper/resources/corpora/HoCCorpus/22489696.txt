Although the expression of extracellular matrix protein-1 ( ECM1 ) has been documented in several tumor models , the function of ECM1 has remained unclear .	[]
In this study , expression of ECM1 was detected by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry .	[]
The role and mechanism of ECM1 overexpression in cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) cells were assessed by wound-healing , matrigel invasion assay and Western blotting .	[]
Expression of ECM1 was significantly elevated in CCA tissues than that in adjacent noncancerous , cholangitis and normal bile duct tissues .	[]
Its overexpression was associated with poor differentiation , lymph node metastasis , poor prognosis , and the level of CA199 , MMP-9 , estrogen receptor .	[]
Knockdown of ECM1 suppressed migration and invasion of CCA cells .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
Using PI3K or IKK inhibitor reduced the level of phospho-Akt or phospho-IÎºBÎ± as well as ECM1 .	[]
Taken together , overexpression of ECM1 may contribute to CCA initiation and progression through promoting migration and invasion of CCA cells , its overexpression was associated with Akt/NF-ÎºB signaling axis .	['activating invasion and metastasis']
